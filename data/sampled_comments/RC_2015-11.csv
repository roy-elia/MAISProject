Meanwhile, the second Death Star is exploding around them and they refuse to leave Vader/Anakin behind. Palpatine escapes in the confusion and they make a speedy getaway in the Falcon, where currently-hibernation-sickened and blind Han has a WTF moment when he hears a certain asthmatic Sith Lord get on board.

Despite that, I'm just not sure Halo is the multiplayer series for me anymore.  I'm not trying to down it, I just don't see the multiplayer having that much sticking power with me.  While I said Arena feels nice, I am pretty sure it won't hold me for long.  

I love the idea of Warzone, but the maps are a bit sparse, I'm not a huge fan of how the cards work (although I can't really think of a better/equivalent alternative given how the mode is setup) and I only have a really great time when I have a small group of friends I'm with.

I'm not saying the multiplayer is bad, I'm saying it's quite good but I'm not sure it has hooked me in the ways that Halo did back in 2007.","1446336003"

(I may have missed some parts of the UI, but then again, the point of a clean/well though of UI is to help everyone, especially newcomers)

The ""find game"" sequence is maybe worse than the other games, a bit less click than BB:CE, but then you have to go from the website to a java applet downloaded. (it generated a ""custom"" one for this match, but I guess I can launch from this same afterwards? ) not a huge deal, but still a chore to have to jump between web and java.

The layout in game is clear and presents all important info on the screen, much clearly than BB:CE. Though on my screen the window was a bit too big, with no apparent way to resize it, had to move the taskbar.

When playing, I still think BB2 has a better presentation, and more forgiving/enjoyable controls. When you pick an unit you can clearly see where it can move, when you blitz you can see how much dice you'll roll, and you can see the tackle zones clearly, even if it was done better in BB:CE. 
On the other hand the game log is near perfect.

So yeah, it's clear, and I feared worse, but I wouldn't say it's the best, at least not ""by far"".","1446336010"

For your current problem, I strongly suggest using power priorites. To do that (with keyboard): Press 4, then q and e to navigate to the ""Modules""-tab. There you can play around with your priorities. You can put your FSD Interdictor to group 5 (least used group) and then even install your shield generator on group 2 (or 1, whatever). The FSD indictor will (due to power shortage) only deactivate, if you deploy your weapons. But because you can only deploy your weapons outside of supercruise and the FSD-I is supercruise only, you wont get into trouble.

"halo","t5_2qixk","An interesting read, for sure, though I was personally a bit disappointed at how focused it was on the multiplayer aspects without any focus on the Campaign element at all.

Being said, I am probably as much an anomaly as they come for the Halo series. I was 14 when Halo 2 came out. I've been playing since the series began and I'm still with it to this day, which technically puts me on your proverbial 'Red Team.' I, however, absolutely loved the Campaign in Halo 5 (it's on par with H2 and ODST IMO) so in that respect I'm a member of your 'Blue Team.'

That disparity is partially why I was hoping you had focused on more than just the Arena multiplayer in your write-up.","1446336012"
"FFRecordKeeper","t5_3779b","What character's you bring isn't that important. The top 3 things you want to consider for a team is:

1. gear, as much RS gear as possible
2. abilities, may fights have elemental or status weaknesses to exploit, and you need enough defensive abilities to stay alive
3. soul breaks, unique soul breaks are having like a 3rd ability slot because they can be mastered and used RS gear in other realms, and they are usually extremely powerful too

Once you've got figured out what gear, abilities, and soul breaks you want to bring, THEN you think about what the best characters are to cover all those needs, although characters are tied to their unique soul breaks, you might have to make adjustments based on RS gear.","1446336012"

"funny","t5_2qh33","It's a butter problem. You either used too much butter (or too little flour), or ignored the chilling the dough part of the recipe. 

The former problem is actually pretty common, since most recipes in the US give flour amounts by volume, which is rather useless, since flour can be packed lightly or tightly, changing the actual amount of flour you're using by a lot.

The second problem is obviously more easily fixable, by simply chilling the dough for longer. It should be quite hard before you bake it.","1446336013"
"thewalkingdead","t5_2rygv","This is the way I took it:

Death always results in returning as a walker, because everyone is infected.

Bites always cause death because they cause the wound to fester, the person bitten develops a huge infection that is resistant to antibiotics and immune response. The bitten person develops a high-grade fever, eventually slips into a coma and dies. Somehow the infection passed by bites 100% results in this - there's no real scientific explanation for why.

Blood/guts/etc possibly sometimes transmits the infection - but rarely it would seem. We haven't seen a definitive example. However they are still necrotic tissue/blood so it would transmit a normal infection if you were to get it in an open wound - this may be treatable with antibiotics/immune response. Unclear as of yet. ","1446336013"

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Yeah true, its whack when its unbalanced either way, whether it's PvE or PvP players only being able to get a certain level of gear. 

In terms of PvP only people being toxic, I think it's just something that is more common with the whole competitive mindset.  Compared to other shooters like Halo or COD I feel like the trash talk etc is way milder in destiny actually. In PvE there's no ""losers"" per say, so it attracts more people who who like that more relaxed, everybody wins, attitude.  In any kind of competition you always have that 'fuck you, get rekt scrub, im better' thing going on. 

Even in real life sports if you want to compete at a high level you have to go in believing that you're going to win, that you're better than everyone.  It also means that you're going to use the best equipment or strats (e.g. blink, thorn, sunbreaker) in order to win. Even in high school basketball, our coach would always say 'when is something a foul? When the ref sees you and calls it'.  You play the game you have, if something is OP then it's bungie's fault, or if people are getting away with fouls then it's the ref's fault for not calling them. 

Does it mean that you have to be a dick and toxic about it all the time? No of course not, but a lot of people are just assholes, and PvP + the internet gives them an avenue to vent their assholeness.   ","1446336014"

If it was modified by an installer or someone else, I would be very suspicious.  You may want to contact your insurance company to see if you are covered for accidents involving this door.  Your liability in case of an accident would be enormous if it's not UL listed, etc..

Breaking Point goes in a different direction and adds a ""class system"" which basically gives you a role, for example Rangers lose ""class points"" if they kill innocent classes vs hunters who get class points for killing anyone.

The biggest problem in the original DayZ mod was the kill on sight mentality and it was difficult to tell what kind of person someone was just by looking at them, which is why the Breaking Point mod has specific skins for specific classes. DayZ standalone has clothing scattered around which allows more customization of how you look but keeps the problem of not knowing what kind of player someone is just by looking at them.","1446336029"

While the technique is cool, it's the end result that's important. Introducing the heat in a weld changes microstructure, and so that fancy 1000 MPa ultra high strength steel you've just welded only has, say, half the strength at its joints, so now you have to have product geometry that takes this into account. What this means is that you can preserve material strength _and_ improve product design.

"mentalhealth","t5_2qirg","It sounds like what you're looking for is an inpatient mental health program, which you'll likely need a referral from a psychiatrist or therapist to get into, rather than a psychiatric stay in a hospital.  Like I said, you need a referral most of the time for insurance to cover inpatient programs and you have to convince your insurance that it is necessary for your well-being (and even if you do most insurances don't cover more than a 30 day program) and if/when you find a program you have to hope that they have an opening for you, as well.  It would probably be better to have an open and honest discussion with your therapist regarding how your feeling about things right now and go from there.  Tell her why you think a mental hospital sounds like a good idea and see what she says and if she might have any resources to help you that don't involve being hospitalized.  I mean, you *could* go to a crisis center and get an evaluation and see what they recommend if you don't feel comfortable talking to your therapist, but then you run the risk of being admitted into a psychiatric unit in a regular hospital and believe me, you don't want that, they are the furthest thing from appealing.  Overall, I get the feeling that you're looking for support more than anything else, a place where you can feel accepted and not judged, and perhaps a reprieve from yourself.  Perhaps looking into group therapy options in your area would be better suited for you?  That way you can work on your struggles in a controlled and non-judgmental space with people who can relate to you while continuing to work and explore your new hobbies.  Best of luck.","1446336029"

you get much better limb pocket hardware, two berger holes so you can run a bolt-on rest if you want, a much better grip than the plasticky thing Hoyt supply, and you get upper and more importantly lower front bushings which will help a lot with stringwalking.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","I went on a date with a great girl from my university classes that I've known for a while on Thursday and we had a great time. The next day we both go to the same Halloween party that we've both been excited about for weeks. 

All is going well, we find each other at various times throughout the night and exchange hugs, jokes etc. I finally ask her to come dance and she agrees, but at this point I notice she's clearly on something (e probably), and struggle to keep up and she basically sprints around the room. 

I end up taking a breather and talk to this chick standing at a nearby table which I guess triggers a jealousy reaction from the girl I like (100% unintended) and she basically immediately comes up to me and hugs me. Not long after we kiss for the first time, maybe 5 seconds. At this point I'm on top of the moon as she runs off and I attempt, again unsuccessfully, to keep up while she goes off like a frog in a sock. Again I get over it (it was actually was really annoying) and go back to talking to old bird standing at a nearby table. 

We chat for a while as I wait for the girl I like to calm down and maybe come over and chill, or at least stop running around so I can dance with her, when suddenly mid conversation the girl I was talking to goes ""hey PATOMARK, your girlfriend is hooking up with another guy."". I look over and sure enough the chick I literally went out with the day before, and who hooked up with me earlier in the night, was sucking face with some other dude. 

Well as you'd expect that pissed me right off. My friends saw the whole thing go down and asked me if I wanted to bail which I definitely did, and we went home. 

I got home and was (thanks to a combination of alcohol and having genuine feelings for this girl) extremely livid. I went upstairs, grabbed my headphones, went straight into my home gym with 2L of water, and banged out 5x5 body weight (+ a few extra kilos) squats (smashed my PB by about 7.5kgs). I've never anger lifted before, but by god was it satisfying. Being drunk had no impact on my form or power, I think the powerful emotions it heightened only gave me strength. 

I know this was less of a gym story, and more of a personal one, however I really needed to vent and get this shit off my chest. I don't care at all that she hooked up with another guy, that's her right considering its only one date we've been on. I just hated that it was after kissing me, and also where I'd obviously be able to see it (about 10m away from where I was). I also hate that it bothered me so much, but I did genuinely like her a lot. 

tl;dr - a girl I like kissed me at a party, then proceeded to kiss another dude basically in front of me causing me to go home and anger squat a big PB. ","1446336032"

Also, from reading the [abstract](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adom.201500402/pdf) it seems they are applying a method similar to back-side illuminated sensors to these new flexible phototransistors, which accounts for some of its higher sensitivity.

It's a pretty spaceship game and who doesn't love space ships

Star Trek

You can easily finish all content (except pvp but no one pvp's anyways) without paying. Not the sure but you have to grind for months some games have either. You can do it with cheap gear off the exchange if you know what you're doing.

Sort of similar to the above but all content is available for free and nothing is pay gated.

Space combat is fun and some of the missions are actually pretty good.

Progress speed is reasonable as long as you're not trying to get the best of everything.

Bad

If you're a min maxxer and like the build optimized characters the cost is truly outrageous. There's no chance 90% of the player base is ever going to afford all the shiny gadgets you need. 

I recently logged back in and tallied up what it would cost to build my characters from scratch and the results were mind boggling considering the fact I hadn't played in a year and the game has powered creeped even more. The break down goes something like 500m ec worth of ships, 1billion+ ec worth of traits and assorted modules, 200+ dollars worth of dilithium if it were all converted from zen, 5m+ fleet marks worth of fleet gear and since I quit before t6 ships were a thing I don't even have any starship trait of which the ones you need are mostly from 25 dollar or lockbox ships. The amount of grinding a new player would need to do to catch up is astronomical.

Ground combat. This one is a bit subjective since apparently some people actually like it but in my opinion it's not as good as the space combat.

tl;dr

Totally give it a try if you want to play around in a star trek theme park and just have fun. Stay far far away if you want to min max your character.","1446336035"

I could be wrong but this seems like it was a ps3/360 game up until very recently and the lack of advancement or design based around new hardware is a huge disappointment. Granted, both MGSV and GTAV were last gen games and they are still amazing on the new hardware but.....it's still highly disappointing that a new fallout will be more of a slight iteration than a full on next gen upgrade.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Here in my graveyard, just bought this new mausoleum here. It’s fun to chill up here in the Black hills. But you know what I like more than dead things? Calcium. In fact, I’m a lot more proud of these strong, beautiful bones that I now have so that I can hold my own against an army of two thousand fuccbois. It’s like the spooky skeleton Jack Skellington says, “the more you thank, the more calcium you have.” Now maybe you’ve read my obituary where I talk about how I thank 20 times a day. You know, I thank 20 times a day not to show off, it’s again about the calcium. In fact, the real reason I live in this mausoleum here is that it’s a reminder. A reminder that strong bones are still possible, because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little coffin across the country with weak bones and osteoperosis. I didn’t have my own dooter, I had no spooky scary self-esteem. But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a skeltal. And another skeltal. And a few more skeltals. I found five skeltals. And they showed me what they did to become spooky and rich in calcium. Again, it’s not just about the bones, it’s about the good death; spookiness, doots, thanks and sweet calcium. And so I wrote a little epitaph, it’s actually on my gravestone, you can read thesd directions here and it’ll take you to my cemetary where I share three things that mr skeltal taught me. Three sp00ky things that you can implement today no matter where you are. Now, this isn’t a “get good bones quick” scheme. You know, like they say, if things sound too dooty to be trooty, they are too good to be true. I’m not promising you that tomorrow you’re gonna be able to wake up with strong and beautiful bones. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know how to thank mr skeltal. So, I wrote a little message on my tombstone. Like I said, now it’s not the most spooky, I just engraved it with a chisel, but it’s real. Nobody can argue, this is my true story. And I’m going to give you the three sp00kiest things you can do today. Invest in your bones. Always thank mr skeltal. Don’t be a fuccboi. Okay, people see messages like this and they say “Ah that’s not sp00ky that’s for some other skelly.” Don’t listen, don’t listen. Be a dooter. Like, mr skeltal, the skelly who started /r/ledootgeneration. He said that he was only 1300 years old when he read a scroll by Hades, and that book changed his bones. Books can change your bones. And in that scroll, Hades said “thank” so if you’re a fuccboi, if you’re not a real skelly you don’t need to listen. Don’t worry about it, I don’t need to talk to every skelly. But if you’re a skelly who knows that there’s something spookier, cause good bones are possible, you know, for some of you listening it’s not necessarily a new dooter, maybe it’s more calcium, a new beginning, starting to build up your bones. Maybe it’s a new death without so many spoops, traveling the underworld, thanking mr skeltal like you’re destined to do. You can't do those unless you understand calcium. Calcium, I don’t call it calcium anymore, I call it thank units. You must have enough thank units to grow strong bones and to doot your way to the top. So, I’ll see you at my cemetary. So just follow this map to my mausoleum here, I’m excited to share this sp00ky stuff. You’ll see, not because of anything of me but because I’ve been fortunate enough that mr skeltal is gracious with his calcium. I love to read scrolls but I also love real personal skelly friends. So let me share with you these three tips that have made my bones strong and rich in calcium. They’re practical, you can do them today, you can start thanking today. All right? See you there. Thank mr skeltal.

i spend a good amount of time researching the product i plan on buying beforehand to avoid this. im petty sure you can do the same.

It's a super cool juxtaposition and it's very intriguing, easy to sing along to, and fun.
The follow up question on whether it would still be a hit now is tough, odds are it would be a cult hit, but that's due to the culture we're in. The popular music scene today doesn't have room for weird experimental rock opera. And that's sad.","1446336042"

Corsi was originally invented as a proxy for possession, but there's also a difference between pure possession and *useful* possession.  For example, you can control the puck for 5 minutes in the offensive zone, but if you're not shooting the puck then it's not useful possession from an offensive standpoint.

Analytics has concluded that faceoffs actually aren't that important in the grand scheme of things, because team can easily compensate for a faceoff loss.  In other words, faceoff wins don't correlate to future success all that much.","1446336044"

If 10 INT is average, and 15+ exceptional, then 3 would be about 30 - borderline profound intellectual disability.

You're really underestimating how low that INT really is.

Until something is done, turn down all your texture and player model options to minimise memory usage, and the game will be stable for much longer. 

I've personally only crashed twice in the expansion, once randomly after a very long session logged in, and once during the Dragon's stand event, however, I have a lot more RAM than average and than is needed for games in general.

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","**All Activities have a satiation point. Some activities have low satiation while others are high. Activities that have naturally high satiation normally is beneficial to you and will help you have a healthy mind, body, relationships, and further self actualization in your life. While on the other hand, activities with low satiation tends to trap you into a hedonistic treadmill.**

------------------------------------------------
For this post, I'll separate the activities into **number1**- activities with low satiation, and **number2**- activities with high satiation.

------------------------------------------

**1. Activities that have extremely low to near none existent satiation are:**

* PMO
* Junk food/fast food
* Reading manga
* Playing video games
* Taking drugs
* Watching movies, anime, romance shows, pornography.
* There's nothing wrong with these activities inherently, but most people do not reach a satiation point of fulfillment and enter [behavioral traps where they enter a hedonistic tread mill of perpetual addiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Natural_and_artificial).

We tend to engage in these activities because of **two primary things**:

1. They are [super normal stimuli](http://www.sparringmind.com/supernormal-stimuli/).
2. They help us [**avoid pain** and **attain pleasure**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_principle_\(psychology\)) at a very low barrier of entry. -Hot babes at a single mouse click away.



-------------------------------------------------------

**2. Activities with a satiation point has an end, or at least gives you a sense of fulfillment, pleasure, and satisfaction that is lasting and will have little to no backlash ([PERMA activities](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/perma.htm)):**

* Physical activities: good work out, biking, jog, run, walk, Bjj, tkd, basket ball, tennis, stretching, etc.
* Social activities: good conversation, playing, flirting, physical contact, sensory engagement-smelling/seeing/feeling/hearing/tasting, wrestling, dancing, fighting, teaching, learning
* Any PERMA activity that you're actually **FULLY PRESENT** and **ENGAGED** with:
 
* Sensory pleasures: eating good food, consuming good art, listening to music, smelling pleasant smells, having pleasurable sensations of feeling textures
		
* Achieving victory, goals, missions, purposes, learning new things, problem solving, creating, imagining, focusing, thinking, visualizing, planning,
		
* One caveat: **ANY PERMA ACTIVITY THAT A PERSON ENGAGES WITH AND THEY DO NOT REACH A NATURAL SATIATION EFFECT SHOULD FALL UNDER SUPER NORMAL STIMULI** and doesn't have a natural satiation point at least for that person in that situation.

---------------------------------------------------------		 
			* Ex. I can eat without concern because my environment and thoughts is set up where I can naturally enjoy it without worry and hit satiation. Others have open access through their environment and their thoughts, routine, and drives lead them to have unhealthy mental patterns and behaviors where they don't reach a natural satiation point and continue without the appearance of any satiation because it relieves them of pain and gives them instantaneous short term gratification at a click of a button type patterns similar to PMO.

--------------------------------------------------
**A good take away is to print a chart similar to this post that has two categories** (you can simply copy paste the activities here and add as you go along in life by asking yourself, ""does this activity have high or low satiation?""). 

* One side will have **activities that have low satiation** and will be **YOUR personal list of things** that you know will throw you into the autopilot behavior trap response.
* The other side will be a list of **activities that have high satiation** and will be **YOUR personal list of things** that you know logically will help you attain more pleasure and will **replace the PMO** type activities in your life.

**Because at the end of the day, that's all our triple layered brains are trying to accomplish. Attain more pleasure and avoid pain.**

The comparison with Valve is not the word ""most"", it's the difference between a few million and 25 PERCENT. Valve is keeping most of the money and Riot is keeping most of the money. But Riot is greedily keeping most of the money while Valve is not greedily keeping most of the money. Valve are just keeping most of the money. The entire point is that you can keep most of the money without being greedy. How? By giving 25% which scales based on how much money is spent as opposed to giving a flat number which doesn't scale.

The current track record only includes races from fall of 2014 because the track has changed a lot, from dirt to poly and back to dirt, turns were widened, etc. and the current track with its current surface has only existed for a year.

Harry talks about what he knows about the case so far and how he thinks the killer is targeting them.
A woman in a turtleneck sweater (Priscilla) gets all up in Dresden's face for some reason.
Anna talks about how 20 women from the magical community have gone missing over the last month and how a tall dark-haired handsome man wearing a grey cloak has been spotted with the women just before they go missing.
Harry says that it's not him and that he's pretty sure it's not Murphy either; they are not amused.
They name three women from their order who have been found dead, Maria, Janine and Pauline.
More importantly, they appear to have not heard about Jessica Blanche, which does not match up with the other murders. A watch alarm beeps from one of the women and they are asked to leave.
As Harry and Murphy are walking back to her car Murphy reluctantly brings up that Thomas matches the description of the man, Harry acknowledges this but feels a little angry about it, which has the side effect of charging up his magic a bit, he discharges the excess magic onto the ground which may or may not have caused a bomb in Murphy's car to be set off prematurely, end of chapter."")","1446336070"

I agree, something does seem a bit fucky here. The narrative felt incomplete and never lives up to its potential, like a huge deviation from the story that should have happened, and perhaps was going to happen until some big redacted event that the devs probably aren't allowed to talk about occured halfway through development. 

I enjoyed a lot of things about Halo 5, but story wise it feels really weird, like a puzzle piece that doesn't fit into the space left by Halo 4 and Hunt the Truth: it doesn't flow on naturally from Halo 4 and it has no relevance to HTT S1 at all. It's like they conceived the main elements of the story in isolation from the rest of the established lore and background marketing material, then bent the lore around it to make it fit. 

I'll stop now before I get any more riled up. Best case scenario, I'd like to see Brian Reed and whoever else wrote the game interacting with the community to the same extent as Frankie and Bravo, answering our concerns and justifying their decisions.

Also, extra upvotes to you for being calm and measured about all this. I think your concerns are about as reasonably expressed as 343 could hope for. I wonder if they'd listen if they started getting a bunch of essays like this one in their emails? There's no way I could express the amount of questions I have in a tweet or two at Bravo.

Today I crafted secret paladin. I've never played the deck in my life and went straight to ranked with it. Lost my first two games from WiFi disconnects. Then I went something like 25-3. I shouldn't be able to do that with a deck I have zero experience playing. The sad thing about my latter wins is I barely paid attention to my oppenent's board state. My turns took 20 seconds tops to just play whatever was in my hand that could consume max mana crystals.

"networking","t5_2qkaf","United States Air Force veteran here. I'll give you what I can off the top of my head. I hope it helps.

* What are the benefits of hiring a technology professional who is a veteran?

There are numerous benefits to this.

Similar to having a college degree, successfully completing a military term demonstrates a certain level of competence and ability to see a lengthy, difficult task to completion. Also similar to a college degree, some level of competence can be expected from veterans, as it would be difficult to complete an enlistment term without gaining practical experience and knowledge.

Veterans who worked in the IT sphere for the military have a very good idea of what a well organized, well maintained, well documented, and well secured network should look like. If ever your network is in need of review of any of these things, you could do far worse than to ask a veteran to audit it.

If your network demands high availability (up time), or is otherwise sensitive in a way that might make other administrators nervous, it won't phase a veteran at all. They'll be used to their networks being extremely sensitive, and also requiring high levels of availability.

* What particular issues have you seen veterans struggling with?

Transition into corporate ""chains of command"" seem to be a point of struggle. Some veterans seem to have a hard time figuring out exactly who they should be reporting problems to, when, why, and what the appropriate action is if they feel their concerns aren't being properly considered.

Another struggle is the VA, provided they need to make use of it. Appointments can be hard to get, and without an employer willing to work around the VA being... difficult, it can be near impossible to get an appointment with them at all.

* What are common mistakes that veterans make when applying and interviewing for a position, or after being hired?

I cannot recall any specific issues that I have seen. I imagine that it is difficult for veterans to negotiate salaries though, as they may have never needed to do so before.

It would probably be difficult to not appear to give an impression of being a very rigid person to an interviewer.

* For those making, or who made the transition, what would be your top suggestions for getting and keeping a good IT position?

The main things are going to be learning how to market yourself, determine what salary you should be getting offered based on your experience, and how to find a GOOD company to work for. A bad company will take advantage of veterans, knowing they may not know better - this isn't unique to veterans of course, but that issue does include them.

* If you're a veteran, what are things that you have struggled with in particular while making that transition?

It was a culture shock for me to be placed into situations where I wasn't speaking with a technical person at all. In the military, your supervisor is (usually) a person who had once done what you now do when they were your rank, and their supervisor has the same relationship to them.

In the civilian world however, it has been my experience that getting a supervisor that has any idea what the IT people working for them actually do is rare. I don't think I have ever been interviewed directly by a technical resource - although I have had them as a part of the interview.

It can be difficult to go from a rigid structure, on a very well regulated network, with a strong support structure, and bosses who know what you do to... well, none of that.","1446336077"

For shits n giggles: every morning between 3am to about 12pm I would become hella nauseous. Every smell, pleasant or not, would become similar to how vodka smells after a wicked hangover. Weed, which I smoked regularly at that point, was unsmokeable most mornings because the taste and etc drove me insane.

I've had nausea for a long ass time but this was new.

Also this entire year my dreams have been ramping up in vividness and weirdness, where before they were rarer. I took 4 naps a few days ago because I kept having insane dreams and waking up.

Earlier this month, when the neck pain was at its worst, I had a dream I was trying to make myself throw up and woke up with a wet *but not thrown up on* pillow.

However, at least where I live, ""Lottery Retailers shall not, at any time, purchase, play or validate their personal lottery tickets at their location of employment."" 

Essentially I'm saying that you should check your rules and regulations as your purchases could be null and void if you have a winning ticket and the governing regulations says something similar to mine. More importantly, it just makes more sense to buy at a retailer; you don't run the risk of an investigative board denying you the winnings if they find reasonable doubt or legitimacy. There are times where doing the logical thing and doing what you have the right to do are different. Of course this assumes that both options are legal.

I know in OP's link, it shows that it is legal for you to game at work, but why would you put yourself at such risk? The statistics is astoundingly improbably with the given information and I would be surprised if at least one of the top three aren't cheating the system somehow. ","1446336081"

Their age, sex, and location already give them enormous odds of previously or still occasionally using marijuana or any other drug. That's a drug charge for many people. Honestly that's enough right there to prove my point. 

Their attitudes and charisma indicate that they are social and like to have fun. Therefore they have a huge propensity again for recreational drug use/getting drunk/illicit activity. Their clothes are indicative of the social group and cultural background they identify with aka young, relaxed, street wise.  They consider themselves rappers which basically is 100% identified with smoking weed. 

As for a psych look, their first idea for a movie is a violent bank robbery. This obviously doesn't mean they'd do such a thing but it definitively suggests that they have at least a mild idolization for criminal and violent acts. Their first idea of entertainment is guns, stealing, and beating police. 

I don't think you realize how prevalent having a drug charge is or a criminal charge is. I meant no disrespect to either of them and don't think negatively about either. I have a criminal record and I'm a young white guy. 

Maybe you should enlighten me about why they're so worried about not being white? Why is that the answer here? You watching too much mass media?

"linux_gaming","t5_2r2u0","&gt; I'm pretty sure the main reason Skyrim's map was so small was due to the limitations of the last-gen consoles. Fitting a vast open world into 512 MB of RAM (including VRAM) sounds like a major challenge. That's also the reason why entering cities, dungeons and single buildings requires an extra loading screen.

HAH. 512mb of ram would have been fine. They are *almost certainly* to be streaming in assets from disk anyway, so larger gaps between areas would have helped the consoles to load more into memory as the player approaches. I suspect the problem originated from either the X360 having very limited DVD space, or just because it was designed that way.

For reference, the PS2 had a *total* of 36Mb of memory and had games like the Ratchet and Clank series which had pretty hefty levels.","1446336082"

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","Exactly this. Also as mentioned above, content addition in Hearthstone mainly consists(and always will) of new cards. You have to encourage players to get these new cards for other reasons than completing their collection. At the moment this is done by making new cards more powerful than older ones, and we can see it's not very healthy approach for the game itself. I just don't understand why Wyrmrest Agent had to be 2/4, and not 2/3, why Shielded Minibot had to be 2/2 and not 2/1, why Mad Scientist had to be 2/2 and not 1/2, and I can go on all night. They would still be viable AND unique minions. 

I agree that bringing new mechanics to the game is a good thing and I know that it can sometimes bring unexpected balancing issues(patron,challenger), BUT since devs won't utilize the best advantage they have - changing card texts quite easily, I don't see a way out of this. What is the reason behind this anyway? Not confusing players too much with frequent changes? Well, majority of them (according to ''best x&lt;10%'' info at mid ranks) just won't give a fuck about some cards being changed. The rest of us who actually play the game more than two games a day, would be confused for like thirty seconds, until the changelog loads.

This isn't salt talking, I've reached legend two weeks ago and haven't played a game since, so my mind is clear. I won't be playing this game much until new adventure comes out and I just hope that when i come back, I will be pleasantly confused:)","1446336085"

&gt; korean products that are superior, but unknown to other countries.

Based on that I only made the Japan comparison to say that high quality expensive fruits are not something unknown to the rest of the world. Sorry if I came off like I was just trying to compare Korea and Japan in some bizarre way. I have found similar fruits in Hong Kong as well. Just mentioned Japan because I am familiar with it.

Anyway I think you are correct that people in the US would have little knowledge of labor intensive high quality fruit. I have no idea about Europe but I'm sure retailers in the US will buy fruit as cheap as possible.

Yes, what constitutes 'boot' has changed.  Win10 gets to the user selection screen far faster than Win7, loading your profile and getting all of your apps started up (i.e. Steam, GoG's version, etc.) however is only marginally faster (if at all) than Win7.  At least that's my experience on an i5 being fed by an SSD. OS X seems to load more of it's OS and services before presenting the user selection screen which would account for the extra time. 

Going by the old measure of needing to be at the desktop with no busy indicator showing (i.e. hourglass or beachball) my 09 MB with an SSD is actually not a lot slower (until it runs in to a brick wall of RAM) than my i5 WinTel desktop which, again, has an SSD boot drive.","1446336097"

I have so far [4 URs and 9 SRs](http://i.imgur.com/RlsLQYR.png), I started to play as SIF came out in English.  
Though I'm not that good, I can't even survive an EX song yet, or I lucked out and survived one a few months ago, but not since then.

Also, do you play Deresute too?  
I have been playing a bit, and I gotta say. The events are really fun to play, at least the one on now.

You pay 30 stamina to play four songs(on the second difficulty, Regular), and the first three share score and combo. You also share HP or whatever the green bar was called that determine how many notes you can miss before failing the song.  
Then you can get perfect full combo if you hit every note on the first three songs and get a score.  
Then you have the encore song. I don't think the score of that one counts, but you get to play four songs for the ""price"" of about two.

Anyways, it felt really refreshing to play that event.  
I have a great time with it.","1446336099"

All licensed gun dealers, which are the people at gun shows that pay for a booth to sell their inventory, are always subject to federal laws that require them to run background checks for every firearm transaction. It doesn't matter if they are at a gun show or in their store, they have to do a background check for every firearm they sell. 

Federal laws allow a private citizen to sell a firearm to another person without a background check. This applies to any time or place, it isn't specific to gun shows. There is no special rule of letting people sell guns a gun show.

One fix I have found is to make low gravity beers. Best styles for me are 4% Saison with Brett, 3.7% English standard bitter. A session Helles using kolsch yeast was a good one too. These have a lot of yeast or malt derived flavor but pretty difficult to get drunk off of. Another idea is a 4% ""gose"" style using kettle souring kind of like Anderson Valley or Almanacs versions.. This is on the list.

I love drinking beer but absolutely hate hangovers, and this is what I prefer to have in my keggerator. Its what I would prefer to drink commercially too but its harder to find on the tap list and at the bottle shop. I'm a little tired of session IPAs too. So my best options are usually homebrew.

Yes, they're called the transgender community. In contrast they think ""gender"" is somehow biologically innate. Personally as a woman, this is quite offensive, considering the feminist movement was founded on the very idea that gender is socially constructed to enforce women's position in the subordinate sex class (gentle, nurturing, submissive, deferential, hyper concerned with useless and costly beauty practices, non-STEM/political/business oriented, overly emotional, etc). To be called ""cisgender"", as if I identify with all of these characteristics is the most misogynistic, sexist term I can possibly think of. 

&gt; Downvote for nonsense in your original post

If you wish you can verify everything in the original post as well. That transwomen claim to have ""female penises"" and that they pressure the lesbian community into having sex with them, calling them transphobic bigots if they insist on not wanting to have sex with someone with a penis (see [""cotton ceiling""](http://secretlyradical.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-cotton-ceiling-links-and-screencaps.html)). You can verify that [88% of transwomen are autogynephilic](https://autogynephiliatruth.wordpress.com/2015/04/27/what-many-transgender-activists-dont-want-you-to-know-and-why-you-should-know-it-anyway/): that is they are sexually aroused by thinking about things such as the following: using tampons, menstruating, having female faces, breasts, or other female body parts, peeing sitting down, etc. And that only 12% are homosexual.

Capitalism, in my view, plays arguably the most important role in creating or exacerbating most of these other issues. Black lives matter, for example, stems from the failure of our economic system to provide decent wages and comfortable lives for people living in destitute and crumbling neighborhoods (which, for historical reasons happen to consist of mostly minorities). When poverty goes up, crime does too. So what do we do?  Instead of fixing the flaws in our economic system, revitalizing and investing in these neighborhoods and making them nicer places to live, we simply treat impoverished neighborhoods like prison camps. We lock up people like animals and treat them like animals. It's because, frankly, we would rather treat people like animals than face reality. We have to stop getting lost in social issues. These issues matter, absolutely, but we have to start instituting practical changes in capitalism before we can bring an end to social injustice. Just my 2 cents, downvote all you want.

"Archery","t5_2r256","Yeah I read your other reply. During step 5b don't only check if your elbow is rotated correctly, but also drawn back so that your stringhand is as close as possible to your body. This way, during release, your string won't have to go around your fingers as much so it will sway less. Additionally, you will get a bit more drawlenght so that the arrows flies with more speed. Also, your hand will go back automatically after the release because the whole process is more smooth. Nothing forced. When I didn't do it properly I noticed by arrows deviating to the right(I shoot left handed).

"science","t5_mouw","You're right to question how we get more power out than we put in. In fact, we never get out more energy than we put in to anything, but sometimes we can usefully convert one form of energy into another. 

Imagine an engine running a generator. we put some sort of hydrogen-carbon compound into a reaction chamber, add oxygen, and give the mix some sort of 'kick' to spark a reaction where the carbons and hydrogens bond with the oxygens, and chemical energy is converted into heat, and eventually into electricity. 

Fusion generators are like that in a way. You add fuel in the form of protons/neutrons/electrons, you give that fuel a kick(often with very high powered lasers) and let the fuel recombine in a way that releases a form of energy we can convert into electricity. 

Saying that you get out more power/energy than you put in is a shorthand that ignores the power/energy stored in your fuel input. 

If it's JUST power you're interested, there are some ways to get put more power than you put using energy storage methods with different charge/discharge rates. An ideal battery might charge a capacitor for 1 second at 1 watt, for example, and the capacitor could discharge 10 watts for 1/10th of a second. It's 1 joule in, one joule out, but the capacitor discharges faster, so energy is conserved, but you technically get more power out than you put in.","1446336113"

How do you apply for health insurance that is free once I possess a terminal condition but am still in a position to function?
I have a final condition but I am still in a position to function, nevertheless, I'm on COBRA since my last occupation wrongly fired me. I'm rich but I simply can't keep spending money on COBRA. I can't go for Medicaid because my excellent physician does not recognize Medicaid and have to bother about spending down it and that I do not desire to owe plenty of cash. I noticed there is an application with both Medicare or Social Protection where all you have to to accomplish is acquire a letter out of your physician saying that you simply have a final disease and fill in several types. You then may receive health insurance for no charge or little as well as your physician must take the insurance. Does anyone have any facts about this? I am not disabled to the level where I can't function, but my costs are a lot of income in spite of the COBRA coverage.","1446336113"

We can not ignore the events of the past few months. A wave of tragic events regarding gender swept recently Israeli society. Starting with the high number of women killed in recent months by their partner to the abhorrent moral event that occurred at the ""Allenby 40"". These events show that unfortunately we have not yet reached the stage where any woman can feel safe in the private and public sectors in Israel.

Many cars have an Aux jack so you can pipe the output into your cars speakers.

You can put a talk on your phone, activate the GPS, listen to the talk on a long trip and have the GPS when it is time to do something.

  In the fridge it is a waste of electricity to put food that is hot in the fridge and also risks warming up other food in the fridge.  If you kept putting hot items in the fridge everyday right next to an item that stays in the fridge for an entire week then it could cause that item to warm up many times during that week so it will go stale or toxic.  Deciding to let food cool down or not before putting it into the fridge also depends on other variables such as the temperature and humidity in the room where the fridge and cooling food are.  The answer is yes and no depending on a bunch of variables.

"Insurance","t5_2qs6s","Yeah, there's no really perfect way, but there's an angle to consider here: you are still looking at having kids down the road but not right now. There's a really good argument that this may be a good time to use the benefits of the HDHP to save up for that potential medical cost.

Let's say you take the HDHP/HSA and put 3500 into the HSA (difference in premium). You're going to need to use a fair amount of medical expenses to exhaust that HSA, and ideally, you will have a good amount left over. If you decide to have a kid next year, you could switch to the higher end plan (if it helps limit costs) and then use the money you saved in your HSA to help defray costs (you can't contribute without the HDHP but you do keep the money) and it's tax free to boot.

My general feeling is that if you're young and healthy without an ongoing or chronic issue, it makes a lot of sense to go for a HDHP with an HSA and put money into that HSA barring some sort of pre-planned cost. For instance, if I had a surgery planned for just after my election period began, I'd be ponying up for the better plan and enjoy the cheaper medical costs, likewise with a pregnancy. But until I get to that point, I'll take my shot with the lower premiums and savings. YMMV depending on your willingness to take on risk.","1446336124"

It is not about debating every single bit, I think it is more about overseeing it,  that there will be no big mistakes that will give us disadvantages.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;  Fats and proteins make you feel full for a long time after you eat.

That's true but I feel like it can swing back in the other direction due to fats being 9cal/gram and carbs&amp;protein being 4cal/gram.

That said though if you eat 50g of fat and protein you'll probably be more satisfied than if it were 65g of pure carbs or even 65g of carbs and proteins.

Proper nutrition to me is knowing what each of the three macronutrients do and why they are important. If you building lean muscle you want carbs and lots of protein. You can ignore fat completely. And you won't have problems feeling satisfied on just carbs and protein because you should be eating 2500-3000 calories depending on how hard you're lifting. 

Or if you're dieting to lose fat and not working to build muscle at all you can ignore macros more. You don't need protein to build muscle and to a lesser degree also don't need carbs to satisfy your glucose needs to *allow* protein to become muscle. You could have an all fat and protein diet (like Keto) and feel really full and satisfied on 1500-1800 calories a day. Or a low fat diet. Or even a low-protein ""junk food"" diet as long as you stay low on calories. (It's just much harder to do that with junk food. Imagine eating a filling steak versus a bowl of potato chips.)

I take a more rounded approach. Avoid stupid fats like butter for more filling fats like meats. Avoid stupid carbs like pure sugar (candy&amp;pop) and instead eat whole grains and fruits&amp;veggies. Proteins good no matter where it comes from.","1446336128"

Or arresting people on bullshit charges (in a country with so many ridiculous laws, there's always people ready to be locked up) just to fill the quota, or extending existing sentences (rules infractions) to keep the quota.

And fuck the ""hotel room"" analogy. These are people's lives we're talking about, usually young people. That's a disgusting way to think about it IMO. Private corporations shouldn't be in the business of locking people away for profit because they run into all the  usual conflicts of interest. Just look at the mess for-profit schools universities have made: adopting the corporate model in higher education. Many professors no longer have tenure or even healthcare, and living from hand to mouth, working from year to year if they can find work, while the deans (like CEOs) get filthy rich, and the students get tuition hikes every year and develop huge loans. 

There are *many* things that shouldn't be run for profit by corporations. Could you imagine what a for-profit fire department would behave like? Or a for-profit police dept?

The amazing computers at chess have thousands of master games in their memory, and they play the moves that led to winning in previous matches.  There's more to it, but you get the idea.  The other side note is that magicians do a trick where they play ~10 master chess players at the same time, and they win half the games.  They just remember what the master player's moves are, and then they copy them on a different table, so in reality the masters are playing against each other without knowing it.  That's why they win half the games, and then they will often add in a few bad players that they actually play, and they end up with a winning percentage.  Computers have won against the best chess players in the world, and it almost seems like Carlsen's amazing memory allows him to do the same thing as the computers. ","1446336135"

&gt;It's not a terribly difficult concept. 

Have you been living under a rock? For thousands of years religious people have forced their faith onto everybody else they come into contact with. There's some myth that, all of a suddenly they've stopped doing this. Sure they don't kill non believers anyone, that's great. That doesn't mean there's plenty of religion still being forced on us. In many places it's extremely taboo to confess disbelief. People get socially ostracized for expressing doubt. The reason it slightly ""more"" ok to be open about disbelief is because of all the push back required. The process in which agnosticism and atheism became normalized was through people saying ""this is fucking stupid wake up"". You have no idea of the fight it took to normalize this. Go to a small town in the Bible Belt and you'll understand how impossible it is not to be religious. Religious people opt for a middle ground now, so as to slow the death of their own religion. Do you think they'd be ok with a middle group if they were as  large of a majority as they once were?","1446336138"

I think if someone is coming across that way, they're doing it wrong, because they're not properly respecting boundaries. If trying to get laid is your thing, I think you can seek it out without having people see you as a threat.

But, geez, I came here to discuss how feminism has helped me out, not to have someone criticize my love life. Why are you so interested in telling me how I should conduct myself in romantic relationships?

"Coffee","t5_2qhze","Sorry, man. Espresso is far more costly and complicated than you'd think. You really shouldn't even bother trying unless you have at least $700 to blow on gear.

Gaggia Classic is a good starter machine.). And then you'll still need a tamper and some other miscellaneous stuff. 

My advice, if your price range is that low, forget about espresso until you can really blow some money. You'll just be frustrated and put out sockwater.

Get an Aeropress for about $30 and then save up for a Baratza Encore (Around $100). You can make something vaguely resembling an Americano. The mouthfeel  and flavor will be different, but it can make a good, strong cup of coffee.","1446336141"

"science","t5_mouw","I've found this in 20 years of taking weight loss seriously, then gaining weight, then losing it:

The key factor is exercise. I got really into cycling for about 10 years- and I could literally *feel* the extra energy if I ate more carbs. Eating fatty foots would make me feel more lethargic. So I needed energy, and would eat carbs- but as long as I avoided fatty foods- I felt great, and could shed weight like nothing. I think people *feel* better if they don't eat fatty foods, and don't feel as bad eating carbs- but not realizing if you don't burn off those carbs they turn into fat.

If you don't work out, I think it's more important to avoid a high carb diet- we don't really store fat as much as people think- but if you just eat a shit-load of fatty foods, you're probably eating carbs you aren't aware of, not working out anyway.

*That's my 2 cents, which is worth two cents- but personally, I think you can lose more weight avoiding carbs if aren't working out- but be prudent. If you do work out, stick to more carbs as you'll need the energy to burn off.","1446336143"

That returns the value in the first Row, second column: B3. In this case (1, 2) of the array is the same as (3, 2) in your spreadsheet.

"dating","t5_2qhb1","Chill Winston! Ok when it comes to communicating it's surprising how much we actually get from context and body language. You can make language learning part of the date and the confusion can be funny. Don't let the language barrier make you shy, don't hold back. Make sure you know the phrases for 'how do you say this in German?' and try and learn a few generics to make fun of yourself. You could also look up a few random words for irrelevant funny items and purposely mistakenly use those words when talking about something. Try and learn at least one compliment...talk is cheap in the same language but when you are crossing the language barrier and it's well placed it can be totally cute cause she will know that you took the time to rehearse that compliment. Hope that helps. And if she appears to be hot for you try and increase the physical contact as quickly as possible, hand to hand contact, hugs....snogging each others faces off doesn't require language...body language speaks for it's self lols","1446336145"

"2007scape","t5_2wbww","Personally, I think it is fine as it is; may not be fair, but fine. It creates a different sort of balance since melee is the strongest of the three with some of the best weapons and lots of spec weapons, but it is also harder to maintain. If you did want to be melee based, you'd pick attack or strength and just train the other back up if you die; most would probably go with strength and try to stay 7 levels over their main weapon (e.g. 67 atk, 77 atk, etc). Or you pick both and let your survivalability suffer for the stronger offence; if you had maxed attack and strength with lower hp and def that would still be very powerful. Linking the two together could work, but I'd say it takes away from some of the more unique aspects of deadman builds.","1446336147"

"lifeisstrange","t5_32tf7","I agree with your initial points-- the story is structured very oddly, and the wrong things are given priority, and with Rachel Amber it seems to fall into the trap of letting characters be irrational so there can be a narrative to work with at all.

The supernatural bits... not so much.

&gt;*This too is kind of circular. We're treated to a coming-of-age story about a teenage girl, and the device used to catalyze her maturation is time travel. Except at the end of the game, we're essentially told she was wrong to struggle to change things in her life and everyone would be better off if she had just sat down and done nothing (literally).*

See, this is why I find the ""Save Chloe"" ending to be fine; Max uses her time powers, realizes she made a mistake and that time travel is no good, and moves on. The town gets destroyed, but, well, she'll have to live with that. Max made her bed, now she needs to go the fuck to sleep.

It's not happy, but it's more satisfying than the save-bay approach of ""it was all a dream.""

&gt;*See what I'm getting at? The whole plot seems to come down to ""Stop struggling. Do nothing."" It's really nihilistic when you break it down, and while some may enjoy that, I don't personally like spending hours and hours on a story, forming emotional attachments to the characters and getting invested in the events, only to be told it was all for naught.*

By the developer's own words, the apparent theme was ""acceptance"". While that is an important theme, surely, one can see how the overall scheme of the game inhibits this theme rather than embraces it.

After all, the 'good' ending is you refusing to accept the mistakes you've made. The sentimentality of the final dilemma, I think, is what blinded people to the issue. And even *then*, the developers have said that the game was always going to end with town versus Chloe, always going to be about the relationship.

A grand vision doesn't prepare you for the stones on the path, I suppose.","1446336149"

It will not ultimately lead to extinction. It will be warmer and the sea will be higher. People can wear shorts and build farther inland.

You're talking about colonizing other planets, which I agree is possible, but living on Earth 6 degrees warmer is a hell of a lot easier than living on the freezing surface of Mars with no no oxygen and barely any atmosphere.

Look I think we should try to mitigate global warming! I just don't think this hysteria is accurate or honest. The fact is no government regulation of carbon will work unless you can reduce worldwide emissions by 80% just through the government forcing people to act against their own interests through taxes, regulations, and other punishments. Good luck getting China, India, the Middle East, Russia, and Africa to reduce emissions by 80% when they are more likely to double their emissions as the world continues to eliminate extreme poverty thanks to capitalism!

"islam","t5_2qhbp","Hmm, I see what you mean. At the same time, I think Reddit posts are a better venue to quote things like this because someone can explain the context to those who might not understand. This is from his book *Turuq al-Hukmiyyah* which is directed to people who will be in government positions and aims to influence how they will shape their policy and laws. 

As to the average person that he sees struggling with this, Ibn al Qayyim would likely have had a very different approach. He's been referred to as the ""Doctor of the Spiritual Heart"" because of his incredible writings on Islamic spirituality and self improvement. He says this in one of his other books:

&gt;“…The smart one does not command people to abandon the dunya, because this is impossible for them. Rather, he has them abandon sins while they are established in their dunya. This is because abandoning the dunya is an optional virtue while abandoning sins is an obligation. So, how can he command them with something optional while they have not even fulfilled what is obligatory?

&gt;If it is difficult for them to abandon sins, he should then strive to get them to love Allah by reminding them of His signs, blessings, kindness, perfection, and loftiness. This is because the hearts are naturally designed to love Him, and if they become attached to loving Him, it then becomes extremely easy to abandon sins and to detach oneself from them.","1446336159"

Thus, the majority of players on the intended platform would have a controller, but having a USB keyboard for the PS2 would be hit or miss.

I can't even tell you the keyboard controls for the game, I only play with a controller unless I'm chatting, regardless of platform. FFXIV is the same way.

This has been a really intimidating campaign, and even I had my doubts about hitting the Vita and Photon stretch goals. Yet here we are at over $900k and very likely to hit $1 million. It was a bunch of work to crunch all those numbers and write all that code, but I'm very glad it seems to have helped people believe in the project. It's been worth it.

I don't know that I'll put in this much effort again until we get something really big coming over, but my [tracking app](http://104.236.40.29:8000/) is already written and ready to go for any other Kickstarters that might go live. People can just give me a shout if there's something they want to track. It costs money to keep the server going so I might add a donation button somewhere out of the way if that happens, but it will always be free.

So I'm in a chain drugstore that shall not be named on Halloween. Me and the girl whose the new gf (been friends forever, so yeah...) were going as the Joker and Harley Quinn.

So needless to say, I looked pretty fucked up. 

I'm getting Red Bull out of the coolers, and I hear some loud whispering in my direction. Herd of grannies. One walks by and 'bumps' into my ass. Needless to say, thoroughly freaked out.

Hands me a slip of paper with her number. 

The other older women can be heard derided me as a hooligan, even though I was going to a damn Halloween party.

Sometimes ads get overwhelming and having something to proc and make sure you don't die while you murder them sounds ace to me.

For Reactive Reload you really need a glove perk that has a reloader for the weapon you're using. I don't know if this perk comes on Shotguns, but if it does, doesn't sound too bad, but this perk is much better on say a Scout Rifle or a Pulse Rifle.","1446336167"

Creative can't even write proper storylines for the women for the matches they have on the male-dominated shows.

The second problem is the same as one of the problems with the 'Divas Revolution'.  Women's wrestling was treated as a joke by WWE for so long (and the divas revolution has done nothing to change that) that nobody is going to feel inclined to watch a show centred around the divas.

[Some Volvo S40](http://buyersguide.caranddriver.com/media/assets/submodel/3989.jpg)

More than anything, [the Lancer](http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2010/08/03/3d374e11-bb7a-11e2-8a8e-0291187978f3/thumbnail/770x433/e94ecf7c057268cfe2053080be78c69d/32381757-2-440-overview-1.gif), but no doubt it was inspired by the GTR.  

Because the car wasn't here, and wasn't that well known, it seems a bit anonymous.  It clearly inspired designs in other cars (the Legacy, Volvo, and Lancer in particular).

Good eye though - it's hard for me to see the Legend as anything but a bigger Accord, after always seeing it side by side with Accords.","1446336172"

"Augur","t5_2qnf6","I was talking about ETC before you could fully trade ETH vs ETH pretty much consistently falling in price since launch. I think most of the down trend is simply a correction due to ETH being valued at initial ETC prices which where in my opinion way higher than they would be if ETC had the same volume available as ETH. This is of course a very subjective evaluation so feel free to disagree that ETC was overvalued. 

Ethercoin data is still available on coinmarketcap even though you cant search for etc btw: 

http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethercoin/ 

My point really wasnt about ETC so maybe I should have left it out as an example, the point was just that an IOU on an asset that is not tradable is capable of trading higher or lower than the desired asset. This was true and not true for ETC depending on your timing and time frame for both buying and selling.

[Rescue walled up dog named Belka / Rescue dogs immured by name Belca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WA4--gvKU0) *TEMPlATE Rustam Vadim |youtube.com*  (Sep 24, 2015)
&gt;On the street at the entrance #4 of Rostov 58/10, a substitution of sand and stone blocks collapsed creating a pit.  
&gt;The hole went about 3 weeks without repair.  
&gt;The children of 4 people climbed into the pit because it was just beneath the steps.
&gt;The approximate time we passed by was 17.15 on September 21; with Novovoronezh my husband Rustam Vadim, Alexander Sotnikov (my sister's husband) and my sister Alyona Sotnikova.  
&gt;My sister and I did not pay any attention to that patched a hole and went home.  
&gt;Then our husbands followed us home and we were told that the pit is sealed and they heard barking.  
&gt;Well, they said that is probably a walled up dog.  
&gt;Then we packed up and went to the utilities in our area.  
&gt;We have asked the utilities but we were told that the work carried out are not public utilities, and DSK and therefore they will not do anything so we decided to do that in the face of it.  
&gt;We came to the door and my husband Vadim Rustam started using a hammer to pull out the cobblestones, then hands to dig out the sand as the shovel was not able to fin in the a gap that the cobblestones were laid in.  
&gt;My husband is a stone removed and saw the face of a dog.  
&gt;He started it slowly pulling as it was pregnant.  
&gt;After rescuing the dog, we recovered the hole and there is no threat to humans.","1446336179"

Nebraska doesn't need to sign a top-10 class. What Nebraska needs to do is get a coach who can bring a reliable system back to Nebraska, and recruit players for that specific system.

This has been done before through restricting children, but why restrict future possibilities. With older generations die out old beliefs- not true in all cases but true enough to make a generalisation. So if the older generation died off at 60, new thoughts and ideas would be far more circulated.

I think Doffy believed that he loved his ""family"" at least. He does care about them, strongly.

But, he will not allow that affection interfere with his goals. If they need to be sacrificed for the greater good, HIS greater good, then they will be. He will be upset by this. He will explore his other options, trying to find an alternative to their sacrifice. He may even hesitate, but he WILL do it.

That is what love means to him: I will care about them so long as they are willing to give everything for me. My love is worth that. I will not punish failure, only betrayal. So long as they are loyal, they I will care about them.

He will love you unconditionally, so long as you don't betray him, and meet his requirements in the first place, but will be willing to sacrifice you for his own benefit.

Whether or not you can actually define that as love.. I feel it's something that would be unclear outside of an shonen series. Is it really love if Doflamingo is willing to sacrifice them? Is it love if he's willing to kill them if they betray him? Or is he simply incapable of understanding what it means to truly love your family, and so his own feelings is just some form of manipulation he himself buys into. 

If his affection was meaningless, just an act, then he wouldn't have refused to make Bellamy an officer. Bellamy is loyal, so why not let him be an officer if it's meaningless to Doffy? Instead, Bellamy had to prove himself worthy, because being a part of his family means something to Doflamingo.

If they didn't bother to communicate with you, aren't bothering to find out afterwards why you weren't there, and *aren't apologizing*, they aren't friends. Sorry you had to find out this way, but it seems they were just acquaintances who never really gave a crap about you.

&gt;my mother believes that I am mentally challenged

She's welcome to believe whatever she wants. And until you're 18 (assuming that's legal adulthood in your jurisdiction), she can drag you off to a psych - so start preparing. Write down this and any similar incidents where she's ignored your attempts at communication, steamrolled over your preferences, and then acted shocked when you declined to participate. Put them on your phone, so when you're suddenly yoinked off to a psych with no warning, you have all the details to hand. You can also politely request to talk to the psychologist without your mother in the room, and literally say nothing else whatsoever while she's still there - she can't control what you say.

Once you're 18, she doesn't have the legal authority to make you see a psychologist. You can politely decline, and if you let her force you to see one, you can tell them equally politely that you are a legal adult being forced there against your will and will be leaving now. (Which is always hilarious. Remain completely silent until any question directed at you is *not* verbally intercepted by your mother, then ""Hello, Doctor Smith. If you'll care to check my records, you will notice I am legally an adult. I have been brought here against my will and do not consent to be here. I am leaving now."")","1446336187"

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Metronome. But, use it creatively. Can you keep a groove(funk, Motown, ballad, country, rock, whatever) with the metronome clicking on all four beats? Easy, right?

Can you keep a beat with the metronome clicks representing 1&amp;3 and 2&amp;4, still easy. Yeeeessiir. 

How about only 1 click per measure? What does it represent? The 1? Still cool. The 4? Now it's tough. The 4-and. Well now we have a problem. No, we have a solution. Work on that for a while.

Then I'd recommend skipping drum machines or loopers, YouTube is full of long videos with only drummers playing grooves (you can start with searches for Bernard Purdie or Stanton Moore). Try to hit your chords on when the snare is played and line your embellishments up to the hi-hat.

Also, I like to pull it for closing, release the handle and, while it closes by itself with *the power of physics* I slide my hand with only two fingers to slow it down with another ""cool"" and smooth effects in my mind.

With the front door I like to have a robotic feel to it, if that makes sense, as I turn the last key and then, as I was programmed, I press the handle in like 0.1 seconds - all for the sake of efficiency.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","If you're into city builders, a game called ""Townsmen"" for Android (and possibly iOS, idk) is a great example. It looks like one of those classic Facebook games where you build buildings and then collect from them, build more, upgrade... except this is an offline game, there are no waiting times - I mean, you'll have to wait for citizens to do stuff, but the game doesn't run when you quit. It's like SimCity and other games in that respect, except of course, more simple. The game is actually free, but you have about 1/3 of the screen covered by ads at all time - for a dollar you can disable it, and it's worth it.

If you're into tower defense, I enjoyed the Kingdom Rush games, both the original and Frontiers. I believe there's a third now.

Plants vs. Zombies is fun too - the second game is free with microtransactions, but personally I prefer the original, which costs a couple of dollars but has none of that nonsense. Plus the new one eats my battery *ridiculously* quickly.

I also remember having a ton of fun with GeoDefense Swarm - another simplistic tower defense game. Interestingly, I think it's only available on Windows Phones. At least I cannot find it on the Play Store.

If you heard about the game ""2048"", you might want to check the original, called ""Threes"". It's much better, in my opinion. Done beautifully and actually is more challenging.","1446336190"

"skyrimmods","t5_2sqqh","Update on my quest to combine [JK's Skyrim](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61035/?), [Legendary Cities](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47989/?), [Enhanced Landscapes](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68782/?), and [Great Forest of Whiterun](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67063/?):  
  
The LOD problem I was experiencing was all load order, which at this point I should have known straight away. By loading Great Forest before Enhanced Landscape and JK's underneath both the LOD problem with the trees went away immediately. I still haven't patched Great Forest to be compatible with Legendary Cities but I'll probably tackle that today or tomorrow, along with a patch to fix the trees around JK's Rorikstead (the patch on the mod page does nothing and the author has acknowledged that, no ETA on a fix).  
  
My goal was to make the Skyrim landscape seem more dangerous and surprisingly the Dark Fantasy Overhaul portion of Enhanced Landscape did the opposite of that. The dead trees were a nice aesthetic but they're far too easy to see through, living trees make it much harder to detect enemies even at close range.  
  
I've added [Immersive Environments: The Marshlands](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30787/?) to my list, it's the only mod I've found that makes the marsh truly creepy to wander around. Loading that esp before Enhanced Landscapes has so far yielded good results but the tree LOD I get doesn't match, I'm hoping once I finish up my load order and throw in DynDoLOD that will be fixed.  
  
And in other news, HAPPY HALLOWEEN! NaNoWriMo 2015 starts tomorrow, and seeing as how that's probably going to eat up all of my gaming time I don't know why I'm messing around with load orders but, what the hell, it's fun.","1446336193"

Meine Aufassung ist: Ein würdiges Leben (Unterkunft, kein Hunger leiden, Teilnahme am grundliegenden, sozialem Leben) zu ermöglichen ist Aufgabe der Gesellschaft (was wir mit Harz4 tun), ein glückliches Leben aber ist Aufgabe des Einzelnen. 

&gt; Über die Details muss man sich natürlich dann kümmern. Ohne größere Steuererhöhungen und niedrigeren Mindestlohn wird das nicht gehen.

Und genau darin sehe ich das Problem. Wenn wir denen, die arbeiten, mehr Steuern aufbürgen damit andere nicht einen Job machen müssen, der ihnen nicht gefällt, kann man kaum noch von Gerechtigkeit oder sozialem Verhalten sprechen. Und können wir das nicht, nehmen wir dem BGE seine Daseinsberchtigung. Denn, wenn nicht mit Gerechtigkeit oder sozialem Verhalten, wie sonst wollen wir ein BGE rechtfertigen?

&gt; Ich glaube, das Stigma eines Friseurs der 10 Stunden die Woche arbeitet ist um einiges kleiner als das eines Harz4 Empfängers. Nur kann es im heutigen System keine 10 Stunden Friseure geben, was ich für einen große Fehler halte.

Auch mit BGE wird es den 10h Friseur nicht geben, zumindest nicht als ""Hauptberuf"". Ohne Mindestlohn und mit BGE sinkt die Bezahlung für Tätigkeiten wie die eines Friseurs, Lagerarbeiters, Kassierers oder Briefzustellers schnell auf 2 Euro die Stunde. ","1446336197"

However... we have another potential reason to return to Innistrad. The Nahiri is Avacyn theory may hold some truth and Sorin may have returned to reverse that so that he may return to Ugin and they can fight the Eldrazi once again.

Now this theory has merits in that without Avacyn to fight/guide the people and her fellow angels, Innistrad becomes pretty fucked. So this could lead to a new demon taking Griselbrand's place to start wrecking shit.

Now we have no idea how Zendikar has done, we assume Gideon, Chandra, Jace and Nissa have sealed Ulamog but we don't know how and if that's a permanent solution. There's also no good way to determine where the others have gone as of now.

If you want to stick local, and be able to see the project someone is working on, you can go to a local REIA (Real Estate Investor Association) and that can be a great way to network and find reputable people who have done projects and are looking for capital to do more projects.

If you're willing to go national, you can join a site like BiggerPockets.com and look at the Marketplace there. There are ads posting deals for sale, private lenders, and wants for both.  You'll probably want to spend a little time on the site first, get to know who the reputable people are.  Who takes time out of their day to give out advice?  Who has projects you can look at online -- pictures, video, detailed information on what they've done?  Who has the experience to take on projects such as flipping or buy and hold where you need capital like that?  If someone has a good track record, they'll have the experience you can see for yourself.  You can also search the site as there are many people like yourself who have already been a part of the site and asked the same question ""How can I become a private lender?""

We also are really suspicious of the CCP because it has a long record of being ultra-scummy without any means of accountability. America is upholding an international law that China is breaking, namely that it can't just go building fake islands to claim the water around it. Literally nobody else of consequence is on China's side on this, so they're asking us to restrain China and uphold international law.

Is this America controlling the world? Sort of. America maintains hegemony through perceived freedom through free trade and a huge amount of cultural charisma. Keep in mind, Southeast Asian countries **want** America's help, and the fact that China overplays its cards by thinking it can just build islands without retaliation. Worse, they make threats that they won't back up, and end up looking like a big, petulant crybaby, like North Korea. This whole debacle is just clear proof that China is neither developed enough to act as a world leader yet, nor is its leadership intelligent enough to understand that the rest of the world aren't fooled or bullied by the CCP as their own people are by them.

To conclude, no. We don't want war. We also don't want an uppity third world country with delusions of grandeur brought from high growth thanks to near-slave cheap labor and stealing technological secrets from us to arbitrarily claim a piece of international waters as its own. That damages our interests and our allies'.","1446336208"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","There was a lot more that went into the decision to divorce him than you point out.  If you read all her posts and kind of read between the lines there's a lot there.  For example the abuse of the two year old child started when the husband was 13.  Thirteen is old enough to know better than to beat a two year old.  Some 13 year olds have been tried as adults for crimes they commit.  It's not like he was five when he was forced to beat a child.

Also, at 29 he's still so dense that he told her J doesn't need an apology from him, but just needs to ""forget about the abuse.""  Then he defends the mom when she emotionally abuses J at their house, and stands up for the abuser when the OP defends the victim.  Then he tells her to mind her own business when she speaks to him privately about her objections to his mom being abusive to J.  Then he lies to her about knowing that J was kicked out of the mom's house and was practically homeless.  Then he blames J for the divorce, then he threatens to turn his back on her and their kids forever when she files (which would be great if he did by the way).

Just reading between the lines here, but I would bet a lot of money that OP's soon to be ex does not think he needs counseling, doesn't want any, and doesn't think the abuse is that big a deal.  

If she ignores all of that, and I'm sure there's more that the OP didn't include so as to not write a whole novel, then she would be really dumb to stick around with that guy.  It's like he's willfully dense.  Yeah he needs counseling, but he doesn't want it.  What can OP do if her husband doesn't think he needs help, nor does he want any.  All she can do is what's best for her children, divorce the man.  Better safe than sorry.","1446336214"

Saying someone is throwing a game is a pretty serious charge, and I would instantly lose respect for any organisation that publishes something like that without substantive backing other than a cursory look on one game and a sample size of games less than ten.  This report just reeks of being a sore loser and blaming the referee for a poor outing by the Fire.  Just an embarrassing witch hunt.

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","I don't claim to know anything about game design or matchmaking design, but this is an idea I had:

So you have your individual MMR. If you queue as a group, you gain ""bonus"" MMR in proportion to how many people you have in your group.

So like let's say for instance your individual MMR is 2000. If you queue with 1 other person (let's say their MMR is 2000 to keep it simple), your average MMR is still 2000, but the ""bonus"" MMR bumps you up to 2100, so you'd be matched with and against 2100 rated people. They can be a bunch of 2100 rated Solo Q'ers, or they can also have a 2000 MMR duo that got bumped up, whatever. If you have 3 people in the group (again, assuming the average MMR is 2000 still), it goes up to 2200, etc.

There are definitely lots of problems to be worked out, like how much each group member will contribute to ""bonus MMR"", how would it interact with multiple groups (say 2+2+1 or 3+2), etc. It's just a very rough idea I had.

So with OP's match, the new guys don't have any MMRs posted on hotdogs presumably 'cause they don't have enough games. Let's just say that their MMR is, I dunno, 1500. If they grouped as a 4-stack, their MMR would get bumped up to ~1850 or so. As a result, they could still go against solo Q'ers that are more skilled than they are, but they have the potential to be more coordinated because they queued as a group. Alternatively, they can also go against a 1500 rated 4-stack, or maybe two 1650 rated duos with 1 solo, etc. I think it would be a lot more flexible than the current system.","1446336220"

You quickly develop some conventions - equivalent to calling convention / ABI - that there's not that much difference from writing it in C. You still need to do some structured programming - functions, passing arguments, maintaining data structures, etc. But it's actually not that difficult - and some are easier.

His videos are famous partly because of their big giant demonstrations executed with great flare and fanfare. That's great but a lot of his videos are for non-major or intro audiences and are at the high school level. You seem to be indicating you expect the same from upper level courses' professors. For example, a professor teaching quantum theory or general relativity cannot whip out giant pendulums to enthrall a class for 15 minutes. It's just not the nature of the subject, nor would it be worth the time: there's too much to cover. Even for intro or ""poet"" audiences, some demonstrations while entertaining are really just illustrating something that's obvious to many students so in some sense it really is dumbing down university to appeal the masses, which is what his famous pendulum demonstration is.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","First of all this study does NOT SHOW that gluten sensivity is not a thing. Let's look at the abstract of the study. He took 30 people which already is far too small of a sample size to draw conclusions in a study of this nature. ALL 30 people thought they were gluten insensitive and all 30 were tested and were negative for celiacs disease. The study then showed that ALL 30 PEOPLE GOT SICK FROM WHAT THEY ATE. That included the people who ate the gluten free diet, it included the people on all the other diets. 

So what this studied concluded is that people who had undiagnosed digestive symptoms all suffered from digestive symptoms. What this DOES NOT SHOW is that gluten sensitivity is not a thing. It shows that maybe these people who thought they were gluten sensitive were experiencing some other form of digestive distress. But they got sick from eating the gluten too. So for all we know some of them were actually sensitive to the gluten. The study is flawed in it's design.

Now secondly there was another study that came out this yearA FULL YEAR after this over one year old study that showed that GLUTEN SENSITIVITY IS IN FACT a thing.

To sum up please learn how to use your brains and think critically instead of reading a title and using it to confirm your biases. And the end of the day there are millions of people who are suffering from digestive symptoms they are trying to fix. So please be a little less quick to jump on a bandwagon to tell them their wrong.

Link to the study that showed that gluten sensitivity is in fact real:

"jailbreak","t5_2r8c5","&gt; No, no no. No.
&gt; They have to have those permissions to literally do anything with your pictures. The right to make copies? Every image on a phone that isn't the one you took the picture on is a ""copy"". A digital copy, sure, but it's still a copy. If no one is allowed to make copies of your picture, the only way you can show it to people is to physically show it on your device. By definition, SnapChat must ""copy"" your picture to share it with your friends.
&gt; Likewise, ""distribution"" means ""giving other people your picture"", or, you know, exactly what you're asking SnapChat to do. You want your friends to see your picture, so you give SnapChat permission to share it, so you don't have to do what I said earlier and physically show them your own device's screen every time.
&gt; Saving and using is part of the same process. Your data has to go to a server before being distributed to your contacts. That means it's ""saved"" on a device somewhere. Without that permission, your picture has to go directly from your device to your friends' devices, which...isn't how the internet works, for starters. But if one channel is down for even a minute, SnapChat has to store your image until that channel opens back up and they can send your picture out. So without that, it would be almost impossible technologically to share your pictures.
&gt; ""Public display"" is to cover them if three people turn and look at one friend's screen. That's considered to be ""public viewing"" and without that permission, you could sue them if anyone other than the ONE SINGLE PERSON so much as glanced at the screen while your picture was up, so they couldn't ever send pictures out of fear that, oh no, someone looked at the screen.
&gt; The reason it's hard to understand is that it all has to be in archaic legalese because our copyright laws are laughably obsolete. Copyright law was designed in an era when ""sharing"" an image meant you had to physically print a copy (or even paint a copy by hand) for every person or group you wanted to share it with and hand those copies to them. Technology as made that much easier, but it's also blurred what it means to ""copy"" and ""distribute"". Our laws have not kept up with that technology, so SnapChat (and Facebook and Instagram and etc.) all have the same basic ""WE CAN DO WHATEVER THE FUCK WE WANT WITH YOUR STUFF"" privacy policies so they're covered in case some court or judge decides that what they have to do to share your stuff with the people you want it shared with violates some copyright law clause, they can say they had permission from you to do it.
&gt; If you actually read through the privacy policies, especially the PR parts that aren't in legalese, they almost always say, ""Look, we're not actually going to steal your stuff, you still have all the rights and control over your stuff, we don't want your stuff, we just need your permission so we can do our jobs.""

Unfortunately not. KInda... By not selecting them you will largely avoid groups that *openly* speak another language, or at least that get nad if you speak English, but there are still going to be people that tick JEDF and come from Japan or *wherever*, then proceed to ignore (or just refuse to admit they don't understand) any and all hails in English, sometimes even in Auto-Translate (as Spanish people, for example, cannot have the game in Spanish nor auto-translate to Spanish).

It's a pain to deal with *when you get them* and the experiences stick with you, but the majority of people you get when you play at reasonable times will be fluent in English or at least know enough to get by, and largely those that can't won't hold you back *too* much. 

It's when you queue up at 3am and get put into a lobby with people who only ticked a non-English language but got matched with you due to lack of other people queueing that things get dicey.

I do feel however that there needs to be something in place to stop people from just ticking all languages to get better queues, such as prioritising people whose primary language matches, which surprises me that it's not been added since the Devs are Japanese and Japanese players *must* be annoyed by the Aussies that play on JP servers without knowing any Japanese, but that's beside the point.","1446336226"

"Surface","t5_2u5h1","First off - LTE only works with AT&amp;T right now....Verizon is no go right now (as of my S3 purchased 10/2015).

I finally broke down and got Surface3 LTE 128/4 after having SP2 and waiting for LTE surface before SP1 launched.

I LOVE that I can finally not have to fiddle with my iphone for a completely unreliable tether to access the internet. I generally can find a wifi at work or at home (my boring life during school), but is so freeing to simply turn it on and have internet access.....FINALLY. Tethering iphone (4-6) never really works and throws me into fits of rage when I get the usual 'secure, no internet'. Spotty wifi at work is no longer an issue!!!! =)

I'm VERY happy with my purchase...I may end up cancelling my i7 SP4 order. The SP2 was powerful enough for me (lots of acrobat 100p pdfs + onenote, web, +/- dragon) and the S3 is only another step forward =) I'd recommend it as long as your not doing photoshop or video editing or something crazy with it - as long as your job/school is your priority and not gaming/photo editing on it. I'm sure you wouldn't regret it. Major neg - it requires at&amp;t, but I'd rather have an LTE surface for $400/y than not.","1446336228"

Fascinating. 30-40 actually sounds really low an amount. How do you compare to Amber?

Blacks have been voting overwhelmingly for Democrats ever since LBJ co-opted the Civil Rights movement from Republicans in the 1960's.  Neither party gives a damn about blacks... Republicans don't care, because Democrats have a lock on their vote... Democrats don't care because they take the black vote for granted.  In fact, it has been Democratic policy vis a vis minimum sentencing laws championed by Bill and Hillary in the 1990s, that has done the most damage to the black community.  Hardly anything has changed for black Americans since they started voting for Democrats 80%.  All Democrats have been doing for blacks is scaring them for the last 20 years saying that the GOP wants a return to slavery, which is preposterous.

Yes, more women vote Democratic, but more men vote Republican, so it is a moot point.  Women are NOT one issue voters... stop treating them as infants that only care about their birth control.

Hispanics have not voted at even a 50% rate for Republicans, so I don't know how you can say they've lost that voting block.

If Russia chooses to deploy troops and launch a full scale operation to destroy ISIS/Rebels (this all depends on the outcome of the recent air disaster in my opinion) the morale of the opposition will be broken very quickly.","1446336232"

"politics","t5_2cneq","No, illegal immigrants don't settle for less money. Just like everyone else they're always looking for better opportunities. Everyone seems to assume that they drive wages down because they're always looking for lower wages, which is not true.

When I ran a construction business we often got people who applied from restaurant minimum wage jobs. We paid $15-$40 an hour depending on experience and the type of work during those days, which was extremely good. But a lot of them did have no status in the country and we did end up hiring them when we couldn't get staffed properly. They're always trying to get better paying jobs just like us.

Now that I help manage businesses in my area, illegal immigrants are not in restaurants here in Idaho. They're in higher paying jobs in the farming and dairy businesses. Almost all of the people in these industries are illegal and they're being paid $10-$15 an hour, while people in restaurants are almost all legal and they're being paid $7.25-$9 an hour.","1446336236"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;I think the picture that people have in their heads is something along the lines of 'consciousness' being software running on the brain hardware. A computer program is not spiritual, but it is something that can be transferred from one machine to another. 

Actually that just underscores my point. If you ""transfer"" a file to a USB stick, or you download a file, what you're really doing is copying the file. The original is still sitting where it was before. Even if you do a ""move"", it's really just a copy plus a delete.

&gt;What about this thought experiment: 

&gt;Replace one neuron each year with an artificial machine that does the same thing. After all your neurons are replaced... are you still the same you, or did you die somewhere along the line?

Well, at the rate of one neuron a year, I will definitely die somewhere along the line before they're all replaced :). But I do get your point. I would say that's not that different from what your body does anyway. Your cells are constantly being replaced, even brain cells to a certain extent, and I don't think the artificial neurons would make a difference. If all my neurons were replaced and the resulting brain physically transferred to an android body, then I would still consider that to be me. If medical science were able to transplant a living brain into an artificial body, that would also be the same person. The key here is that there is a physical transfer. The line is drawn when a copy is made. At that point it's no longer the same person.","1446336241"

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","I agree with your main point that AFCE doesn't really have an argument. But Lewis is totally a starting RB in the traditional sense - he's been (surprisingly) getting way more than 13 touches a game on offense. The only reason he's gotten fewer is (1) injury and (2) Pats run Blount after the game is out of hand. 

For reference, Lewis has 243 snaps in 5 games (he was held out of the Jets game with an injury). That's an average of 48 snaps per game. ","1446336244"

But what you need to do is set it to file output only in broadcast settings http://i.imgur.com/QkRfdBc.png. Then in encoding you'll want to turn off CBR, set the quality balance to 10, max bitrate to 1000, then use custom buffer size and set it to 0 http://i.imgur.com/2RM3iR5.png. You can set your video settings to whatever you want, but i generally downscale it to 720p using the 36 sample downscale, and use 60 fps. This is where it gets interesting. In advanced, You'll want to set the process priority class to high, change the x264 CPU Preset to ultrafast, encoding profile to high, keyframe interval to 0, and then the most important thing, check the Custom x264 Encoder Settings box, then type in ""crf=10"" http://i.imgur.com/nqPTO5i.png.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","I'd love to speculate about which mechanics will return.

* **Flashback**

This one seems like a given. Flashback is heavily played in both casual and eternal formats, is dearly loved and seems to have plenty of mechanical space.

*  **Transform**

I think this will be the ""Landfall"" of the set - a mechanic so iconic, they just can't leave it unused. Incredibly deep as well, so we can be sure that it still has space for design.

* **Morbid**

For an ability word, you could do far worse. Morbid is also a somewhat popular mechanic, and one that still has plenty of mechanical space. It isn't, however, directly linked to Innistrad, as stuff dies absolutely everywhere, but if they were to return Morbid, now's the time.

* **Fateful Hour**

I'm certain this will not be used. It's alright as a mechanic, but the idea of ""Humans are screwed even more"" doesn't need to be sold like in Dark Ascencion. The mechanic itself plays... awkwardly, as it feels quite bad to cast a spell and not use its full potential, but it also feels quite bad to be at 5 health.  

* **Undying**

Undying was received fairly well, but I think it also won't make the cut, or, if it will, just barely. It's not plane-specific, it can be used only on so many cards, and it has to be very carefully balanced in order not to make it a nightmare for the development team. Let's face it, if I say Innistrad, Undying usually isn't the first, or even the fifth thing you think of.

* **Miracle**

One of the most contraversial mechanics in the game, you either love it or hate it. It tends to lead to a lot of feel-bads (ask LSV) and is sometimes just a frustrating mechanic to play against (ask legacy players). It's the ""Annihilator"" of the set, so there's very slim chances of it appearing here.

*  **Soulbond**

This mechanic is barely remembered. People, who liked the idea of pairing up creatures might find it alright, but for everyone else it was just forgettable. Aside from the fact that Soulbond occasionally irritates judges, there's also not that much to remember. It also doesn't seem to have a whole lot of design space left, so it seems it will also be missing Innistrad's return.

i think that the top three mechanics likely to return, in that order are: 

**Transform**

**Flashback**

**Morbid**, with **Undying** in close fourth.","1446336246"

Many companies are a little leery of new hires also.  Once you get in and show them how well that you work, you might get pay raises quickly.  Companies often take care of people they know are good workers.  Either way, you get a year of experience at a local hospital that you can use to find a better paying job in that area.  If I was hiring, I would be a little nervous about someone moving to area too.  I wouldn't take it personally.  Each company HR has different flexible or unflexible hiring  policies.

While in the Comic Osman says that the biological agent is unknown, I think She knew full well where the agent came from, Argent Moon. ONI is on hand ""right in the nick of time"" to seize the bio-weapon and detain the Sanghelli looking supposedly steal it In Issue 12 of the Comic. WE later learn that the Sanghelli has been working for ONI for quite a while. The Argent moon mission in Halo 5 takes place in OCtober 2558. I think I think it might have taken that long for ONI to locate the ship, since its AI, Ruker did many things to prevent further contamination before Terminating himself.

US would like increased oil. Now Gaddafi a guy the US could and did work with for MANY years is dead. Replacing it is a less moderate government where Islamic fanatics are gaining power and the country itself is in chaos.

Counting first win of day at roughly 250 IP and than 76 IP per 25 min match... Playing for roughly 5 hours a day it would take you like a year and a half to obtain every single champion...  
Of course there is many things to consider. Games are longer/shorter win/lose rate and fact that u wount always play same amount every single day. Than there is also different game modes such as the double IP weekend or Party Week where you can potentially gain x5 IP gain but also fact that new champions are released every so often it may be longer or shorter...

So I'm trying to teach them, but they all suck. Really badly. There's about two who have been able to follow my instructions, so I was helping them progress further because they actually had potential, while the rest of the were stuck on one of the first steps.

One particular child sucked really badly, and he kept coming back to me trying to get me to show him the simplest steps over and over again, and overtime I did he still couldn't do it. I had to tell him to just go away and keep trying, because I wanted to help the ones who could us my help, but he just kept bugging me. So I yelled at him.

A lot

I may have called him a pathetic failure, and I may have told him to go and sit the corner and shut up.

And he may have left and cried.

That's not the point when I thought ""I'm a horrible person."" No, that came latter, when someone told me that he had cried, and I burst out laughing.

That's when I thought ""Wow, I may be a horrible person""

Personally,  I like dams.  They reduce any anxiety I might have over my taste,  and they prevent me picking up a yeast infection from someone's mouth pH/sugar exposure,  which has happened literally every time I have oral sex without a dam,  unless I get them to gargle with vinegar, which obviously is something I can not expect of a hook up.

Don't act like Israel has done nothing to curb the actions of Palestinians in a peaceful way. It doesnt matter what Israel do they will be attacked regardless.

By your logic, Israel should suck it up and let the attacks die down. Perhaps they have the capability to do it, but I doubt anybody has the patience, inside and out of Israel. The problem is they wont and history poves it time and time again. 

Unfortunately the Palestinian grave gets dug deeper and deeper with every attack, and the end result will most likely be a complete take over of Palestine. Of course if the Palestinian leadership can control their people and educate them and Israel has more moderate leaders then peace can be arranged, but im afraid there is too much irrational hatred for there to be a peaceful solution.

Again at the top you have a helmet icon, click it, you can setup your build in that panek with most things unlocked already.

"fo4","t5_2tzv4","Most of this isn't too bad and I like your overall approach. Aside from PC likely not having as many issues (if a feature is seen in one place, it can likely be set more abundant on better PCs) a few claims are a bit off.

With life-like lighting...well example: I went outside the other day, during a cloudy day, and took a good look around...the lighting made it so almost nothing cast a shadow ANYWHERE, it was simply the effect cause by the atmosphere at that time, almost everything looked bland and lacking shadow, much like the beam at the gas station scene, it was full cast by shadow with the only light source being the sun and not hitting it elsewhere, this won't always lead to a HBAO (or AO in general but HB seams to be the most realistic) effect, some things simply get washed out, the same can be true with things in direct sunlight.

So a lot of your points are good things to note and maybe see how they differ on PC, but not all ""bad lighting"" is actually bad if the world is set up to be realistic rather then fixed lighting for an artistic or cinematic approach.

That said MOST of your points were good as well as you're overall end view =)","1446336257"

It was clear that the person you were talking to was NOT literally saying that she was paying money to the exchange to support other people's insurance subsidies.  It is disingenuous of you to suggest that interpretation.

You then tried to say that some how only all the money to pay for current health-care subsidies comes from some tax-the-very-rich law.  I provide information on where some of the funding for aca subsidies come from ""AKA the congressional budget"" and you dismiss my argument without addressing any of the details I provide.  The creators of the ACA believed that the medicaid cost reductions would fund more than 1/3 of the subsidies - in other words they would take the general tax funds currently used to pay for medicaid, and where do funds from medicaid come from?  again, the congressional budget, which is primarily funded by taxes.

Stop nit-picking the little stuff and trying to cast her in a bad light.  Neither you nor I know more than she has said about her finances.  What I do know is that if she doesn't qualify for the subsidy, she pays taxes.","1446336260"

[Rescue of walled up dog named Belka / Rescue dogs immured by name Belca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WA4--gvKU0) *TEMPlATE Rustam Vadim*  (Sep 24, 2015)
&gt;On the street at the entrance #4 of Rostov 58/10, a substitution of sand and stone blocks collapsed creating a pit.  
&gt;The hole went about 3 weeks without repair.  
&gt;The children of 4 people climbed into the pit because it was just beneath the steps.
&gt;The approximate time we passed by was 17.15 on September 21; with Novovoronezh my husband Rustam Vadim, Alexander Sotnikov (my sister's husband) and my sister Alyona Sotnikova.  
&gt;My sister and I did not pay any attention to that patched hole and went home.  
&gt;Then our husbands followed us home and we were told that the pit is sealed and they heard barking.  
&gt;Well, they said that is probably a walled up dog.  
&gt;Then we packed up and went to the utilities in our area.  
&gt;We have asked the utilities but we were told that the work carried out are not public utilities, and DSK therefore will not do anything so we decided to do that in the face of it.  
&gt;We came to the door and my husband Vadim Rustam started using a hammer to pull out the cobblestones, then hands to dig out the sand as the shovel was not able to fit in the gap that the cobblestones were laid in.  
&gt;My husband is a stone removed and saw the face of a dog.  
&gt;He started it slowly pulling as it was pregnant.  
&gt;After rescuing the dog, we recovered the hole and there is no threat to humans.","1446336260"

Perhaps it's something they are planning to implement. Among many others coming (e.g., Thar****s)?

I mean, why do all the ""once in a lifetime"" things too early, when your user base is still growing and major features are still being added to the game?
I'm sure it will happen, but when they feel there is a big enough fan base, the game is more feature-complete, and there will be enough media buzz to make it a major ""Event"".","1446336260"

You can hint that certain outcomes are better, but as long as you don't twist fate to ensure that your set outcome happens then you're not railroading.

&gt; For example: a moral choice where one of two potential heirs to the throne dies. Railroading is saying that whichever one dies, events carry on the same. Perhaps this is something unexpected happening to make sure nothing lethal happens to heir A, or perhaps this is having exactly the same nobles back whoever ends up in power.

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","343 has also said that they are reconsidering adding splitscreen back in the next version of Halo due to the backlash.

Counting the number of people that use splitscreen is the wrong way to estimate its importance. It is also the same incorrect thinking that led MS to focus more on the TV features for the XB1. They saw that people used their xboxes more for its multimedia capabilities than for playing games. That might be true once people bought the console, but as they've since learned, it is the games that get people to buy the console in the first place.

Likewise, splitscreen might not be used all that much, but when it is used it is highly desired. I have a friend that comes over to my house maybe twice a year. When he's over we play splitscreen/couch coop games. I'll buy games just to satisfy this little used but very valued need. I haven't done it in years, but when I was younger I'd go to LAN parties maybe once a year. We'd buy games just because they were LAN party friendly.

I don't own an XB1 but was seriously considering it just to get Halo 5, another couch coop game. While I don't know how my personal anecdote translates to the larger gaming community, I can tell you that the removing of splitscreen in Halo 5 has killed any desire I had to buy the game or the console.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","It all depends on what level and format that you're playing at. 

Red and blue are most often a *tempo* style deck/color combo. You want to play a cheap and efficient creature, and you want to use that creature to beat down your opponent while you buff it and protect it. Cards like [[Counterspell]], [[Lightning bolt]], [[Unsummon]], etc. can pave the way for your creature to get through. Good efficient creatures you might find as a newer player could be the Standard legal [[Monastery Swiftspear]], the Modern legal [[Delver of Secrets]] and [[Young Pyromancer]]. 

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/3po9jt/a_word_to_budget_deck_builders/) was a great list of budget Standard decks. The best budget UR decks look like they are in there. 

The Origins intro decks have the UR color combination. Intro decks are intended to be introductory decks to the game. Although you'll probably outgrow a lot of those cards pretty quickly, it's a starting point. 

I hear [Magic card market](https://www.magiccardmarket.eu) is trustworthy. Not being from Europe that's the only one I recognize. I'd definitely check with some local shops to see if they have stuff, always try to support your local game store as you can.

Whether you're comparing Skoal Mint to Copenhagen Mint or Husky Straight to Cope Straight to Copenhagen Straight, they're all made by the same company, they're just slightly different products released under different brands. As a company, USSTC is trying to maximize their market share - and they do that by trying out different products under different branding.

"applehelp","t5_2rfbh","Your computer will run at about a 3rd of the speed if the battery has failed or is not detected but should still be usable 
Do you have trim support enabled for the SSD?
Try a NVRAM and SMC reset. 

NVRAM - turn computer on and hold command option P R at the same time until the system reboots and chimes again if you see Apple loading animation (or progress line), you didn't get the keys pressed fast enough 
SMC reset - with machine off and connected to power press and hold(on the left side of the keyboard ) control option and shift
While pressing these press the power button. 

If your charger adapter was orange it should cycle to green and back to orange 
It's harder to check if the battery is full as the light will remain green.

Stuff to remember:

1. **Titles make the post.**  
 Good titles are critical to quality content.
 * Explicitly, the suggest title button is usually terrible.
    
2. **Do people want to see this?**  
Content isn't limited to what's in the suggested submissions list but it's good to go over it.

3. **Is this the original source?**  
Nobody wants to click a link and then click a video. Just link the video.

4. **Can I add value to this post?**  
Most posts benefit from a little elbow grease.
 1. 9 times out of 10 you should link the source, not the article.
 2. Videos are better when linked at the relevant time.
 3. Gifs are easier to enjoy than a video. [Gfycat](http://gfycat.com/) has a convenient tool for making them.

If you're good with the conditions above, go ahead and post it on /r/StreetFighter using the link below.

"fnv","t5_2rzr5","I looked over the quest rewards list [here](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_quests) myself and there seems to be enough to get by.

So my  general answer to the quests is, yes but not easily in hardcore mode. 

If you want to play in Hardcore mode or with Project Nevada it will get much  harder

In any case you should allow yourself  other items you'll  make as part of a quest (ain't that  kick in the head gives you one healing powder)   Also you probably should allow yourself to use anything you get from the Courier's Stash. That's usually enough to get you through much of the game. 

If  you do that you might get enough food and with care, water and ammo to make it. 

If you count this an an ""honest laborer"" run which it is , I'd allow myself to spend any caps earned as reward from work and doing this will  pay for food, ammo and repairs for the service rifle and 9mm that will be your constant companions . They are cheap to feed and fix which fits the concept well. 

You will definitely want the Grunt perk from Honest Hearts for the damage boost, It works with both  those weapons and keeps you good into late game. 

You also have another chance to get a service rifle as a quest reward and if you count items you pick up as part of an unmarked quest, The Humble Cudgel as well. 

If you get to liked by the NCR they'll give you a radio and you can request supply drops. This will have 9mm, 5.56 ammo and sometimes .357 rounds which can be broken down at the bench and made into 9mm . 

This is  considered a quest called emergency radio and will give you ammo and weapons and is repeatable. 

Energy weapons are a bit more limited being Pew Pew which is hard to get and a few others, they are there and with ED-E and the Brotherhood you should be able to get enough ammo. 

If you are alright with hunting and foraging as well you might allow yourself [Bottle That Water](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34840/?)  and [Animals Have Meat](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/36041/?). You are going to get attacked anyway till 10th level at the earliest and might as well get something for it.

&gt; A movie about the First World War based on a stage musical of the same name, portraying the ""Game of War"" and focusing mainly on the members of the Smith family who go off to war. Much of the action in the movie revolves around the words of the marching songs of the soldiers, and many scenes portray some of the more famous (and infamous) incidents of the war, including the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, the Christmas meeting between British and German soldiers in no-man's-land, and the wiping out by their own side of a force of Irish soldiers newly arrived at the front, after successfully capturing a ridge that had been contested for some time.

I've never been on 8chan but I can't see how anything on KiA would make you want to throw up, that seems a bit far for what I have only seen to be reasonable discussion.

&gt; GamerGate is largely playing out on Twitter, and if the movement is about ethics in games journalism, logic says the majority of tweets on the #GamerGate hashtag should be directed at games journalists and their employers and not at game developers.

Uh, not really. Surely you know Zoe Quinn's involvement in the whole GamerGate movement? From my understanding she was part of its creation, her relationships with multiple video game journalists who promoted her 'game' Depression Quest without disclosing their personal relationship in those articles in which she and her game were mentioned.

You should know this since you've been following GamerGate.

Also, to look only on Twitter would be looking at only part of what GamerGate is. 53,621 people currently subscribe to KiA, it's fair to say that a lot of GG discussion goes on there; Twitter's design doesn't even encourage discussion anyway.

&gt; Twitter users have tweeted at [Zoe] Quinn using the #GamerGate hashtag 10,400 times since September 1. [Nathan] Grayson has received 732 tweets with the same hashtag during the same period. If GamerGate is about ethics among journalists, why is the female developer receiving 14 times as many outraged tweets as the male journalist?

Like I said, she was in a relationship with multiple journalists. They didn't disclose this information and promoted her and her work. Was she not at all at fault? I can't say she wouldn't be. The whole situation with Eron and Zoe blew out of proportion but that's something that is barely even discussed anymore. Zoe does more than 'make games', her activism at the UN was something GamerGate was discussing too along with her other tweets on various topics.

I'd say GamerGate is not only about ethics in games journalism but about ethics in the gaming industry as a whole. I've seen the discussion expand into some other topics in gaming and it seems perfectly reasonable to do so.

&gt; [Stephen] Totilo [editor in chief at Kotaku] has received 1,708 tweets since September 1—more than Grayson but fewer than Leigh Alexander. Alexander got 13,296 tweets, nearly eight times as many as Totilo. And Alexander’s only crime was writing an op-ed critical of so-called gaming culture—GamerGate hasn’t even accused her of any malfeasance.

Come on.. She was directly targeted GG with her articles against gamers. 'Gamers are dead' is what she said if I recall correctly. Of course not only GamerGate but gamers in general are going to have a problem with someone saying that, it's just sensationalist click-bait and it caused as much outrage as she hoped I would think.

Not to mention that numbers of tweets is meaningless. Do you think all of that is harassment? How much are trying to discuss things with these people? The numbers really aren't saying much, assuming they're accurate since this is some kind of subscription based 'news' site.

&gt; Yep. It's really all just about ethics in gaming journalism. Which is why people supporting Gamergate spend almost all of their time harassing women who aren't even journalists, whilst doing next to nothing to actually engage with the gaming media itself.

You say you visited KiA but I can't find this harassment of women you're talking about. If you could find me some from KiA that are being discussed now and ones where they are encouraging harassment of women in particular I'd appreciate it.

The thing about engaging with the gaming media is a lot of them are biased. So biased they ignorantly generalise GG as a 'hate mob' and only spread that narrative further. Then you also have people like Anita who I quoted in an earlier comment:

&gt; SXSW should reinstate the online harassment panel and release a statement apologizing for including the GamerGate panel in the first place.

This is what the gaming media and people like Anita Sarkessian are like. GamerGate wants to engage and discuss but they can't because they're met by people who want to silence them. Why aren't you criticising that?

If you really want to generalise GamerGate as a 'hate mob' then I hope you're being consistent with your logic and do the same for feminists as there are certainly some feminists that harass other people so we may as well generalise all feminists as a 'hate mob'.","1446336281"

Doflamingo is a great example of someone who cherishes his allies, yet is ruthless to everyone else. It's been demonstrated multiple times. He held back on attacking Law to protect Jola. He forgave Diamante and Trebol for their failures. He explicitly told Viola that he forgives his family for their failures, only does he punish those that betray him. His backstory with the top executives tells us that he owes everything to their loyalty. Even giving gratitude to Vergo and Monet for their service. 

He values his crew in the same way Luffy does. Yeah, Law talked shit but Doflamingo gave Corazon any chance he could to prove that he wasn't a spy, and even when he inevitably killed him-- he clearly didn't want to.","1446336283"

"Surface","t5_2u5h1","I don't know. Notice the article doesn't say he heard this from MS, but is instead just says its on the website. It hasn't been there that I've ever seen and I have a tab open just hoping to catch mine come out of Out-of-Stock so I see the page a lot. It could of just been a mistake. 

I would also say that 128GB is going to be small for a student over the course of their college career and into their first job. Mainly becuase your life will be on there, but external storage works as long as speed isn't critical since they are slower (at least with SSDs its not as bad as with HD). 

You lose 11GB from Win10.  Solidworks recommends 5GB+ of space for it (btw, it also recommends 8GB RAM). 

If that that model does come out, you should at least make a list of the applications you'll need and look up their requirements and see where you would be w/ 128GB. Office or OpenOffice should be one. If you play any games. Your school might know what you'll need in future classes. Also take a look at how much memory on your current computer is stuff that will get moved to the new one. And all this is before you start taking notes, taking pictures, making videos, etc.

As for bang for your bucks...

First, I believe the processor ability is up about 15%, but the the savings averages out to more like 10% because the savings vary from task to task.

One thing about getting a faster processor is it continually saves you time. Only you can value your time. But it does mean whatever the cost of the processor difference (factor out if the SSD or RAM got bigger) it keeps costing you less the more and longer the computer is used.

You will be using some tools that would definitely get a punch from the 10% and be doing some operations where that will be a noticeable saving in just that one operation, i.e. rendering something in 9min instead of 10min. If you render once a day it's 6hr over a year. If you render 4x a day its a day over a year. 

It will be a rough idea, but I guess what you could do is estimate the hours you spend doing stuff on the computer per year, times .4 (10% time savings over all, 4yrs duration of use), divide that into the $ difference, and then decide if you'd pay that per hour to be doing something else.

It was cheap and amazing and clean to live here until the 2000s when fucking Californians thought they were being original and moved here.  Now houses are 5x what they were, the food culture is gone and has been replaced by SoCal food culture , and YES - Black people along with poor and middle class have been driven out of the city to the outer rims of town because rich Californians give their kids money to go live in Portland to discover themselves.  Rich white people from California have snatched up and remodeled all the houses.  Now the culture in this city has been white washed and dumbed down and is no longer the amazing city it used to be.  Someone like me who grew up here in the 90s and had hopes and dreams of one day living downtown are now strangers in a foreign land.  

If you are thinking of moving to Portland - DON'T !  You're not welcome by people who have lived here their lives.  You and others like you are ruining it and turning it into an expensive shit hole like the place you are trying to escape.  Please don't move here.

"GGdiscussion","t5_3a3as","I mean, it is an inherently ridiculous argument to expect a creator to change their product based on it being offensive to others.  Especially when the source of the offense taken is a giant set of titties (or something equally inane).  For 99% of the time we see a controversy arise due to someone being offended, it is a non-issue in my mind.  Creative and expressive freedom is sacrosanct.

The common AGG rebuttal is that they are ""only fighting to have a more diverse set of characters and that not all women should be scantily clad.""   I think there is a mountain of evidence to show this is not their intentions. In fact, their actions and the speech they commonly rally behind, says otherwise.

As for the ""point scoring,"" I personally see this as a one sided issue as it is routinely one side attacking devs for ""offensive content.""  The controversy around Hatred could be seen as GG point scoring, it could also be described as ""GG defending a game from censorious assholes.""

There might be a line to draw about the specific commercial use; that they're not specifically profiting from the use of copyrighted material, but that seems like a stretch to me.

Anyways, anything shown on stream already is done with the permission of the owner/creator (usually it's fan art or something that has been specifically made for use on Rollplay) and more specifically JP and Steven have stated Steven wanted to show his collection of inspiration art, but couldn't because of copyright issues.","1446336291"

As for why the tracking camera doesn't follow stage 1, the payload will always be the primary focus of a launch. 

So until the 1st stage lands back at the pad, or SpaceX/NASA invest in [more](http://egy24.com/wp-content/uploads/112.jpg) tracking [cameras](http://vandenberg.airshowjournal.com/2002/Img_0972.jpg) we will have to rely on short glimpses in the stream after stage sep and amateur footage. 

I am hopeful that we will see a stage land back at the launch site by the end of 2016 as long as there are no other failures. That means we will almost certainly have high quality tracking footage of the first stage all the way from stage sep to landing by the end of the year. ","1446336292"

There was one crash were they kept fighting over control of the plane and didn't even know it.   The control sticks aren't connected and are not in between the legs, but on the sides and it's all electronic. Each pilot has a button to override the other.   The co-pilot literally crashed the plane because he was an idiot and kept pulling up while the Captain, thinking he had control of the plane, thought the plane was fucked the whole time the co-pilot was dooming them..  Captain was trying to nose her down to stop the stall... co-pilot was pointing the plane at the sky...

Then you have the one in NYC where the pilot broke the tail off with too much rudder..  another one with pitot tubes... another one with something else stupid.

To many engineering ""gotcha's"" or piss poor training ""gotcha's"" on Airbuses...   No thanks...

"Assistance","t5_2s25d","$1300? Jeez. I have to tell you, if she recently broke up with you I feel like that'd be a pretty severe waste of cash. If anything it'd only buy you maybe another few months at absolute best. Just because she's crying doesn't mean her mind isn't made up. Proposing after only seeing someone 3 times who lives in another country, plus it seems like it was really one sided. I couldn't imagine being in a long distance relationship where I put in all the work taking the trips to see the other person and they weren't working or saving to try and make it real.  

My advice - if you were to collect the $1300 to visit her, thats basically a part time solution at the most. Its putting a band aid over a gunshot. What you really need to do if you care about her as much as you say, is get your act together. Get a job and get to a place in life where you can afford to visit her/move in with her/marry her... It sounds like she was willing to stick by you for a while, she was taking it fairly serious, but from your story it doesn't seem like she was getting an equal effort back. Even if you love someone with all your heart, that will take its toll and get old. Asking for money won't help anything. Even if you get it and buy a plane ticket it's not going to help. You have to fix yourself and your situation first, then if you're lucky you may be able to work on the relationship.","1446336293"

Not sure why that matters but thats when i've noticed it the most, perhaps its just harder for the gimbal to stabilize from that position.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","An incredible amount. 

Imagine an explosion of hot, sharp pain in the center of your abdominal. It's a pure pain, the sort that says ""Dude! You're damaged and you're going to die!"" 

And then you wish that the oblivion would just hurry the fuck up! 

The pressure in your gut is intense. You feel razor blades at the base of your throat as you scream a guttural cry that lasts as long as you have air in your lungs. You can't breathe in. 

Tears are streaming from your eyes as all of your muscles tense, bringing you into the foetal position, your hands clamped solidly, yet gently around your scrotum. You want to empty your stomach. 

You want your mum to pick you up and protect you the way she did when you were a small child. You're trying to find an escape from a white-hot reality and would gladly do ANYTHING to be somewhere else right now. 

You finally get a half decent breath and immediately waste it on another nearly silent cry; it would not surprise me if you didn't hear it though - the pitch is somewhere near, or above those bloody pest deterrent things people stick in their front gardens. 

The pain lessens to a loud ache and you start to relax, contemplating moving enough to sit. Your hands move slightly, testing the tenderness of your incredibly important (and pretty damn major) organs. Your whole body spams slightly to the orange-hot wave of Pain that flashes from your core. 

Being more gentle you try again and find that you can actually if you take your time about it. You rearrange yourself to free up a hand and slowly push yourself up.

From here it's fairly boring. Moving triggers a hot and heavy ache. Moving quickly is completely out of the question. The small novae aren't worth it. It's wearing off now, not quickly and in stages. 

Breathing deeply now feels wonderfully cooling. You shiver occasionally as the adrenaline is purged from your system. Flexing your arms and legs to work out the stiffness, you eventually stand up before pacing around a bit. After a while, you find yourself able to deal with it and life goes on. 

Edit: To anyone who mentions period pains... 

* If you have ones that hurt as much as I did in this experience, I sincerely feel very sorry for you. I would also suggest you seek medical advice.

And to remind you, MHP has traditionally supported AKP dictator-aspirations. They voted for AKP to be speaker of parliament and have voted for AKP proposals in the past.

"discgolf","t5_2qk68","Afternoon showers coinciding with when I get off work to play are the norm here during the Summer. A few things I can tell you about playing in the rain:

* The best course is the wooded, hilly, rocky one that offers some protection from the rain and wind and drains fast. The worst are the flat wide open, grassy golf type courses everybody likes when its sunny. They can become muddy swamps quickly.

* Towels don't work when wet. Synth chamois or camp towels do.

* Don't let enthusiasm for playing blind you to erosion damage done to a course when playing on it before it has drained and dried. 

* There is a huge difference in playing in summer rain and soul crushing cold winter rain. 

* Don't underestimate how chilled you can get how quickly even in a summer rain. Pack a breathable rainjacket like Goretex or equivalent.

* Don't be caught in the rain wearing cotton. That includes jeans and tee-shirts.

* Disc down to whatever you can grip well and throw accurately. People make a big deal about types of plastic that do marginally better when wet. But the best plastic is dry plastic that you are confident in to throw to best effect.","1446336299"

SAA can't guard the entire highway, can always be cut off at a point where security is minimal. But can always be taken back quickly once the government knows where to hit. 

ISIS need to be kicked hard in the teeth to discourage these actions. Obviously men will be sent to counter attack against this breach, [VegasPunk] (https://twitter.com/IvanSidorenko1/status/660590787382611968) already reporting reinforcements being sent into the area. 

Second thing to do to discourage these attacks is take Palmyra since that is the town that opens up all of Western Homs to these attacks and serves as the staging point. Again [VegasPunk](https://twitter.com/IvanSidorenko1/status/660567005242765312) reporting that the SAA parked outside Palmyra just waiting for the order to storm the town. Another SAA offensive would be tough given all the fronts active at present but its needed. 

In short if ISIS wants a fight give them one, but in Palmyra and away from the highway. ","1446336303"

Just a theoretical question you probably will not be able to answer ... if I were gonna buy either the Sennheiser HD700 or the Beyerdynamic T90, which of these two would suit my preferences better? In very short sentences, what is the sound of the Sennheiser HD700 described like, and the sound of the Beyerdynamic T90?

Maybe a question you are able to answer: The Sennheiser Momentum 1st Gen have a 3.5mm/1inch plug, but the other end of the detachable cable is **less than** 3.5mm/1inch. Doesn't that effectively mean the entire Headphones are designed to sound nice with the less-than-one-inch-plug? If I've got a  6.35mm Plug for the source on the one end of my detachable cable, and a 3.5mm Plug on the end leading to my Headphones themselves, that'd be the exact same as 2x 3.5mm Plugs and therefore senseless (no quality bump), right? Regarding the Momentum, is it safe to say the sole reason they ""increased"" the size of that one plug on one end of the cable is that it fits into my MP3 Player / Smartphone?

It seems to me as if the Momentum and its terrible cable was solely designed for ""casual"" smartphone users, which I find to be unacceptable at it that price point. But then again I don't know a whole lot about current headphones industry, I'd love if someone could enlighten me.","1446336303"

The child would not be yours in any way, and I don't think you would have an easy time giving up a child you had carried for nine months (as you said).  Pregnancy, child birth, and post-child birth sucks enough but at least you get your baby in the end.

Instead, start thinking of your options to have kids.  You still definitely have time at 30.  If you would like marriage before kids, start dating again.  Your thirties are a good time to meet someone who is wanting a family as well.  Or, if you're okay without a father in the picture, and have the means to support a kid on your own, perhaps start looking into options such as a sperm donor.","1446336304"

1) what left wing books

1b) Americas right is so far off the charts that by todays standards Nixon would be a liberal and Ike a commie, so this is just people hysterical that works dont repeat what they believe

2) why does everything have to be political?

No. Please, please, do not pretend that you have.

&gt;I mean, you do believe in the magical sexist Bernie supporter the, Bernie Bro.

That's true. It's just a new name I found out about minutes ago, specific to the presidential campaigns, but these same neckbeards have dominated reddit since its inception.

&gt;Funny how of course these people have to refer to the gender of these people too.

Heheh yeah, it's hilarious.

&gt;You know to just do a real good job of generalizing to all male Bernie supporters.

Okay. This has been reiterated time and time again. You... you know I'm also a guy, right? If not, well, there it is. I'm a male Sanders supporter and I definitely do *not* identify as a BernieBro.

So let me say this loud and clear: I do not think all male Bernie supporters are BernieBros. No one ever did. That was never the point. Not for one second. That's your invention. You're the only one who has claimed that.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","1. Don't random. Randoming is for fools. 
2. Learn a few heroes really really well before trying to be a jack of all trades. This improves your game heaps.
3. Look at the minimap. If you see an ally in a shit position tell them. 
4. Don't be afraid to play passive. Most lanes can be won just by not dying.
5. Don't think about what *should* be happening, thing about what *is* happening. If your team isn't playing crash hot, don't play as if they're playing perfectly and then say retarded shit like ""OMG if you were helping me I would have lived"". There is no excuse for dying stupidly, even if, had your team been playing better, it would have been fine. 


I just wanna rant about #5 a bit. Seriously, this is the most retarded attitude I see in the game - ""I'm going to play in any way I want and if my team don't perfectly handle the situations I get us into, and if they don't completely facilitate the way I want to play, it's their fault"" and usually it comes from players who have seen their team make some mistakes and have decided that it's on them to ""be the playmaker"" from now on and for some reason it involves farming in stupid places and going for stupid ganks and then blaming the team when they feed. 

If you die stupidly due to your arrogance, its not your team's fault. It's your fault for being stupid. Take responsibility for the fact that you're a dumbass. 

It's like farming when you have no wards up - so many carries take this as ""hey this means I can farm wherever I want and if I die it's the support's fault!"" - but sometimes you're gonna have games with KotL + Gem, or Zeus, or Slark, and you won't have wards up because the enemy team are on top of dewards - and so not knowing how to farm with limited vision makes you stupid. Sure, the support should have wards up, but if you die it's still your fault. Not being able to farm without wards makes you a bad player, and it means you'll fail in any game where the opponent is on top of dewarding. Also means you suck vs. smokes. Bad player.","1446336309"

I'm not sure what you're responding to. I disagree that protein is the preeminent macronutrient. Do you have a source on that?

&gt;It doesn't necessarily have to be meat.

I was responding to this string of comments:

""Any of you have advice on what i should eat as a side instead of pasta, potatoes, etc?""

""Add more meat...""

&gt;Plus, eating more meat is better for you than eating too much carbs like sugar and pasta.

That's a bit nuanced to break down since carbs range from table sugar to wood. I would argue that a whole grain pasta, rice, etc. properly portioned would long term be a healthier alternative to meat. Again, it's nuanced so it's not exactly an apples to apples comparison. Also, grains aren't just carbs. They also contain protein, some have fat, very complex carbs like fiber, etc.

&gt;The only meat you should be avoiding is processed, smoked or preserved.

Most research shows that eating any significant portion of meat increases your risk of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, and in general shortens your lifespan.","1446336311"

"nyc","t5_2qhu2","&gt;Additionally, the constitution was made in a way such that amendments can be repealed. 

Then they should propose the Constitutional convention and actually do it the right way.  

Wrong ways: 

Tax schedules that get closed, creating de facto bans and price barriers 

Cause requirements that create de facto bans 

Feature tests that create de jure and de facto bans 

Etc.  

If another right was treated this way, like say, the interpretive result of constitutional guarantees of privacy and equal treatment that manifest the right to an elective abortion before viability, it'd be shameful.  

In fact, you don't have to imagine that. 

It's exactly what Texas' ""ambulance"" laws which just shut down abortion clinics does.  It's erecting material and legal barriers on a right instead of respecting that right because the legislators involved are bigots who know they can't just directly shit on the Constitution. 

And that's even at the level of an interpretive right.  

The second amendment is part of the original bill of rights. It is doctrinal, not scholastically made, and yet a slew of bullshit from 1934 onwards Federally and from the early 1900s in NYS. 

And speaking of your beer:

You're not a date rapist, domestic abuser or drunk driver.  You don't rape, beat, or kill people.

I'm just trying to spark conversation. Hex has 3 sources; none of them can be purged by the targeted hero and there's plenty time to jump on them while they are weak. Hex is a disarm, slow and mute in a bundle.

Break itself, however, can be purged by popping your BKB/euls/diffusal, and Break does not apply on a target that's already spell immune.

My point: You cannot 100% reliably utilise break in contrast with hex, due to one being self-purgable and the other not.

For what it's worth, I don't think I was interested in him as more than a friend anyway (though I never really got a chance to make an assessment since he left after an hour). I was happy to chat to him over a couple more drinks, though. The thing that has really shaken me up was the lying - he looked me in the eye and had a proper conversation about what kind of drinks I like, if I like gin etc. It scares me that someone could lie so brazenly like that, it really does. The entire time planning to run out of the nearest exit.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","I play control warrior and was up to rank 4 omw to legend the season TGT was released. I knew the game really well (you have to with CW because you have to exercise a lot of discretion on card choices, removals).

Then the Secret Palidin deck came around and it was obvious really early how much Blizzard failed to test it. In games where I had perfect draw AND they had the worst draw possible  (unplayable cards turns 1-3, no mysterious challenger until turn 15 or later), I'd win. The rest of the games I would lose. Even start? Loss. Perfect brawl  (everything dies except my stuff)? Still lose. The fact that a pali player could HOLD a turn 6 card at the start is atrocious.

For all the talk about how Blizzard cares about money first. I have this to say. Before MC I was regularly buying a few decks a month and bought 50 decks in TGT. I also bought the adventures etc. Every purchase just helped my control warrior improve and keep up (Deaths bite, Sludge belch, Dr. Boom, Nefarion) as it did other classes. 

MC has completely for the permanent future changed my willingness to spend money on HS. I do not plan to ever spend another penny and tell my friends not to spend money at this point. It is because suddenly my money felt wasted when my favorite class was so completely decimated by ONE class getting a broken card that was OBVIOUSLY broken. TGT ruined the game and I know its temporary, but it has made me think Blizz will repeat this error in every future expansion.","1446336317"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","If you want to see what happens to a journalist in the corporate media who attempts to report an actual left-wing story, you can look at what happened to Gary Webb when he wrote his [Dark Alliance](http://www.democracynow.org/blog/2014/10/6/inside_the_dark_alliance_gary_webb) series.  Hint: the dude's career was destroyed, and he wound up killing himself, even though his story basically held up.  My point is that the very way in which journalists define their job (how they define what constitutes ""the news"" and their common sense beliefs about how you are supposed to report it) is politically conservative and shaped by an institution that is dependent upon advertising revenue.  In journalism school, aspiring journalists learn: 1) that what constitutes ""the news"" is what elected officials and government spokespeople say; 2) that values that are out-of-sync with those of the major political parties (socialism, for instance) are ""crazy"" and ought not to be taken seriously.  This means that when journalists write stories, they simply repeat what the politicians say.  Any journalist who gets funny ideas about writing a story that suggests that major politicians are ""liars"" or war criminals, or that US foreign policy is racist and imperialist, or that capitalism is incompatible with a functioning democracy (a key idea for the left) will be driven out of the profession pretty quickly.  This does mean that the advertiser purchasing ads for United Airlines complains to the press and gets that journalist fired.  It simply means that actual left-wing reporting badly violates the common sense understanding of what journalism is.","1446336318"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","First of all, Southern states are majority Republican, not nearly unanimously Republican.  In Southern states, the white populations tend to be more Republican than whites elsewhere, but the black populations are still almost entirely Democrats, and a significant number of whites do vote Democrat (especially urban whites, young white women, and Northerners who recently moved to the South).  In 2012, Georgia only went 53% for Romney over Obama, South Carolina 55%, Mississippi 55%, Louisiana 58%, Tennessee 60%, and Alabama 61%.  Obama won Virginia (which includes a lot of Washington DC suburbs) and nearly won North Carolina.  Even a vote of 60% or 61% indicates that Democrats are a significant percentage of the population.

Next, there are historical reasons.  At the end of the Civil War, almost all blacks lived in the South.  In the early and middle 20th century, the ""Great Migration"" was a mass movement of millions of blacks to leave the South and move to cities in other parts of the country - especially New York, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and St. Louis, and in later years Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Racism certainly was significant in those places also, but the South was far worse, and many blacks in Northern and Western cities were able to get political power and middle-class jobs that had been denied to them in the South.  However, even after the Great Migration, about half of black Americans still lived in the South.  In recent years, blacks have been moving out of Northern cities and back to the South, often leaving inner-city neighborhoods with high crime and failing schools.

Before the 1960's, Northern blacks voted for both parties, Southern blacks were mostly prevented from voting at all, and racist Southern whites voted Democrat.  In the 1960's, the Democrats finally supported civil rights while the Republicans of the time mostly opposed them.  Southern blacks became able to vote and did so in massive numbers for Democrats, and racist Southern whites who were voting Democrat became Republicans.  The black community has been solidly Democratic ever since.  Also, some (certainly not all) leading Republicans have been willing to use racism to get votes, and as long as they do that, that eliminates any chance of Republicans breaking through with the black community.","1446336320"

&gt;&gt;We'll have to agree to disagree.

&gt; Considering you're flat out wrong, you might want to read up on the law

I already said I wasn't talking about matters of legality.  When I said I disagree with the statement ""In a lawful arrest/detainment, you do NOT have the right to defend yourself"", I wasn't interpreting the word ""right"" as ""legal right"".

We disagree that cops have rights that other people don't.  We don't disagree that cops have legal rights that others don't.

&gt;&gt; If someone a police officer walked up to me and said ""you're going to leave or I am going to make you"", and then touched me, that touch is a physical escalation.

&gt;Then you're an idiot who would very rightfully deserve being tased/physically taken down

I didn't say I'd fight back, I said it would be a case of physical escalation.

No, I don't ""deserve"" to be assaulted by anyone, regardless of what clothes they're wearing.  That's a ridiculous moral position.

Be prepared mentally for both results tho. But it's better to have tried and get rejected then not to try at all, that's for sure. If you don't do anything the end result is basically like you got rejected, no?

And no dude would be offended if a girl asks him out. 

As for how to do it, I think the note is alright. Something along  the lines of ""Hey I like you, and I'll be leaving soon, so I might as well say it. I like you and I'll miss you if I leave and we lose touch. Here's my number."" Optionally, you can add ""can I get yours"". It would be even better if you say this to him in person (if you can manage) and through in some non verbal cues. 


Point is, he should get that you like him, but without being too overt/over the top. Sometimes just a look is enough. But nothing wrong if you're open about it either, the clearer the better in a way. Shy guys tend to be oblivious.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Right, that's what I figured. Well in order to play it on the new console, I would need to download the DLC. So to clarify now, with the home set to my brother's xbox, my *account* has *access* to *play* the DLC on any xbox that has it as long as my home xbox account has the DLC. However, that xbox has to have *a* home account that actually *owns* the DLC to play it on that. So when I migrate to my own xbox, I will need to buy it for my own, not because my account isn't able to play on it, but because the new xbox doesn't have a home account with it on it, I will need to buy it. In which case, I should just simply buy it once I migrate to my own xbox.

**TL:DR** I can play the DLC on my brother's xbox for now. When I get my own xbox, I will need to buy the DLC either way because even though my *account* technically *can* play the DLC, I still need to buy it so that I can play on my own xbox.","1446336330"

Shoot a Bladedancer with Truth (or any rocket with G&amp;H, which is all you use in PvP) and proximity will detonate the rocket before it impacts the target. This means you lose a super minuscule amount of damage, but just enough for that Bladedancer to survive.

The front of the N6 is shorter the 6P, but on the N6, from the glass to the back is angled slightly and the back is a little longer on both sides, so if you look at the over all length, they are identical, but if you're just looking at the screens straight on, the N6 looks slightly shorter.

The screen size is smaller because the phone is narrower, but retains the same aspect ratio, and then whether it's battery, the front facing speakers, the word class camera, pick a component... They needed the extra room to fit it. Especially when it's narrower so they're still looking space to store this stuff, as well as thinner. So they decided to go up instead of out.

"USMC","t5_2qswv","Finally in front of a full-size keyboard.... 

I'm attending Texas A&amp;M's Maritime Academy in Galveston, TX.  It's structured like a military academy, but is nothing like what you and I experienced while we were in.  It's slobs leading with a half-ass attempt of order/discipline.  Oh well.  

The academy is structured in companies with 2 (I think) platoons per. 

If you are an 18 year old freshman, they make you live on campus in the dorms.  This would suck.  If you are going to school as:

* a transfer student with prior college credit, or already have a degree
* are married
* a prior service veteran
* or, are over 25 (or 26?) years old

you will be placed in a separate company, known as Victor Company.  I'm in it since I am all of the above, and can live off-campus (as can all Victor Co.).  We are kind of on our own program, and wear a different colored belt in our uniforms to designate that we basically have more life experience than the others.  

I mentioned uniforms, yeah... it sucks.  I had to spend $1,400.00 on US Navy regulation uniforms, as well as stupid school clothes.  Had to... no way around it.  I have to wear a Navy Class C uniform whenever I'm on campus between 7am-5pm, so basically always.  

I'm in the marine engineering program, called MARR, and in that program there are two options, LO or non-LO.  LO is License Option, which is an internationally recognized license that the US Coast Guard will test me on in a few years.  It will allow me to work for any company, on any ship, in brown water (intercoastal/river) or blue water (international waters/way the fuck out there).  Almost everyone goes for the LO, because you will make lots of money.  

Like I said, I'm in the marine engineering program/engineering license and will graduate as an Engineer 3rd Mate, but you can go for a deck license and be a loser with no knowledge of how a ship works.  I'm mostly kidding, but it's actually much easier to get your deck license than your engineer's license, and it shows in that there are about 10 ""deckies"" for every engineer in the maritime academy.  It will be harder for them to find work once they graduate... not impossible by any means, but I'll have a much easier time because there is a higher demand for engineers.  

I was actually going to go for a deck license, but I'm so fucking colorblind I failed every color-test required by the US Coast Guard.  Go figure that the engineer's vision test isn't color-strict.  Also, I was a crew-chief on an amtrac in the USMC, and easily handled embark/debark operations on US Navy amphibious ships.  Ah well.  

The school is expensive, and as an out-of-state student I'd be paying at least $24,000+ per year (not including the hidden $2,000-$9,000 price for going on various cruises every summer to rack up the required ""sea days"") but by serving in the maritime academy I automatically get in-state tuition.  This is good because I only had 6 months of GI Bill remaining from completing my last degree, a 4-yr B.S. in Product Design &amp; Development.

Not sure what else to say...

There are only six maritime academies in the whole USA, and I had never lived in Texas, so I said what the hell.  Texas Maritime Academy is not the best one at all, (Maine Maritime, SUNY Maritime, and Mass Maritime are all better IIRC) but I'm from up in northern New England and don't want to deal with long, shitty, winters.  

Starting salaries are supposed to be decent, and I've been told it'll be around the $100k level.  I like this... a lot. Also, the schedules are basically split between the time you're out on a ship and your time off.  So if you are on a ship for two weeks/two months/whatever you'll have that same amount of time off.  Again, I like this.  

You generally won't be tied to any one location, so you can live where you want, and you'll travel to the port to meet your ship, or your helicopter ride out to the ship if it's already underway (out to sea).  

Hmm.. some of this might not be 100% accurate, but close enough for you to get a basic idea.  Feel free to ask any other question, and if I'm not sure about the answer I'll do my best to find it for you. ","1446336333"

As an admitted layman on the topic I find myself more convinced by the natural explanations for how the followers of Jesus came to believe that he had been resurrected than by the supernatural explanations. Especially when contrasted against the stories found in other religions that have become popular through what to me seem like perfectly natural events. Joseph Smith and the origin of Mormonism being a perfect example where believers see supernatural origins and non believers (like you and I) see much more reasonable natural origins.","1446336335"

I think it's crazy you'd through in your 5 year marriage for a guy you've only known for a year....what's going to happen in 5 years with this other guy....will you meet someone else and decide you're in love with them.

Marriage is hard. Sometimes I love my husband, other times I wanna murder him. Sometimes he's the smartest guy I know....othertimes he's just so stupid. Marriage is not the same for everyone, but I do know that it's hard work. Like I think ahead to 30 years and I just can't even fathom having to spend that much time with him....but it's happening.

You should try spending more time with your husband....before making any big decisions. Do all the things that your doing with your 'best friend', with your husband who in my opinion should be your best friend by default.

At least if you try to work things out...if it doesn't work out in the end you can say you tried.

I got in a crash in California where even though I was travelling a good distance from the car in front of me, it was a Lotus Elise which has one of the best braking performance in the world. I was cited at fault for the crash. Luckily, because I was was a good distance away, the accident barely damaged either car (though a barely damaged Lotus is still a grip of money). If I killed that driver in front of me, you can believe I would be charged for negligence. 

Jenner was going so fast for the conditions that not only did he slam into the car in front of him, sending it into oncoming traffic and killing the woman inside, that energy wasn't enough to slow him down much and he crashed into the car ahead of that one.

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","&gt; Saryn will probably require significantly more work to get high damage output

What it's also going to require is significantly more *energy*. They're actually expecting you to use Venom, *and* Contagion, *and* maybe Molt prior to Miasma to get a comparable effect. 

This might be cool once or twice, but I imagine the 1,000th time you have to cast an ability 10 times and do 10 melee attacks prior to triggering your ult it's going to get pretty tedious.

Synergy is good, but if the changes require 3 times the effort and 3 times the energy then the payoff needs to be greater than 3 times the prior version or else it's a nerf. There's incidental synergy, and then there's *forced* synergy and this seems pretty forced.

Now if you want to look into their analysis and their financial sheets and see just how many loopholes and payments towards lobbyists and benefits from corruption there are and then settle the real results, we can go from there and see if there company is being real or not.

Also with Schlum, a company that specifically indicates people as part of the pillars, their own employees indicate it isn't so and thus that's even more reason to believe it has nothing to do with being unnecessary. They are getting rid of their consulting practice for mission statement reasons and shareholder pressure. That's it. Nothing else.

I'm failing to see how you plan to have an objective and fully informed view or analysis on these events if you're not even willing to do research and figure out the real facts.

The true reality is that corporate corruption is far too prevalent and earnings far too irrational. You shouldn't shed a single tear for any corporation.

The corporate corruption has everything to do with things when mentioning profit or revenues.","1446336351"

Another way of saying the same thing is that a bodybuilder doesn't view accessories as accessories, since they are just as important as what one considers ""main lifts"" (deads, squats, press).   In any case, as an older competitor, I have to emphasize that although progressive overload works, it is not the holy grail of bodybuilding.  Adding 5 lbs per weak would, over the course of a 20 year career, mean that by the time you are ready to retire you would be hitting about 5,200 lbs on all those lifts.  There are lots of other ways to create the intensity needed to challenge the muscle enough to grow--progressive overload is just one of them.

Still, in my desktop I unplug the fans from the motherboard just to be safe. All powered off, obviously. 

I guess the only real danger is that blowing high-pressure canned air through the outlet can cause the fans to spin faster than they were designed for, and in the wrong direction. Might wear down the bearings prematurely or knock it off-axis.","1446336357"

"SanctionedSuicide","t5_2wiyw","&gt;  The ""baseline"" of existence is one of negativity, we are essentially born in a state of deprivation and spend our whole lives trying to get out of that state. The money removes a lot of life's negatives indeed, but what could you possibly need the money for if you weren't put in the negative state by life itself, in the first place?

I don't see being born rich with good looks as something negative, it's a neutral state, while having anything less is being in a state of negative. Some needs come on a wimp, not from a prolonged craving that causes discomfort, by satiating those you're doing it just for the release of endorphins, provided there are no discomfort attached to ignoring them.  

&gt;Even if the 500k removes the majority of ones negative circumstances, the 1000k would still be used to satisfy desires and needs created by the ""need machine""/body.

Those additional needs arise from socialist society manipulating the ''monkey see-monkey want'' dynamic, what if we manage to become Buddhist lama who managed to forsake mortal values or live in a Marxist society where things like Louis Vuitton handbags never existed? Would we still crave for them? 

&gt; The world is just the five senses, so no matter how much money you have all you will be doing is satisfying those senses

Doesn't that make both negativity and positivity relative illusions of our being? 

&gt;I mean, what are you going to do - Drink more expensive wine, shit in gold toilets, flying around the world and see different sights, prop up your ego and flaunt yourself around? 

No, provided I had much more money than 1000k and my current desires fulfilled I'd try to create an Utopian casteless society where everyone is equal and its main goal would be to minimize suffering.

&gt;and the hedonic treadmill principle would eventually come into play as we are designed to be motivated but never satisfied

true

&gt;And eventually you will face death and not want to let go of your fortune, causing suffering.

Personally I'm not afraid of death no matter of how successful my life could be

Also I really approve of the AN philosophy, but this part bothers me, because I can see how something positive can be achieved in the absence of negative, really hard to practically achieve though

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Well, I don't disagree with you there, but I think that example highlights one of the weaknesses of passer rating.  It's a very basic statistic measuring efficiency per attempt.  But production/volume does matter too.  A rating that measures a QB's overall game performance should look at the game as a whole too.

Brees for instance is often inefficient relative to Wilson, but the Saints rely far more on his passing to win games, and passer rating can't account or that (and to be fair to Wilson, raw passer rating doesn't account for his running yards and TD's).

Also, what if instead the first guy goes 3/30, 270 yards, 3 TD's?  Then really despite being ridiculously inaccurate, he's provided the same amount of production as the more accurate guy.   The additionally completions don't really add that much more value, other than perhaps something intangible, like tiring out the defense.  But then we can look at time of possession or number of (passing) first downs directly, rather than completion percentage.","1446336360"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","This is actually a really complex topic that you're only skimming the surface of. It's usually called ""teaching **to** the test"", and the whole argument depends on what the test is and what the standards are that are being evaluated.

To give you an example, if a state has 4 Bio learning standards (cell bio, genetics, evolution, ecology) for their standardized Biology Exam but the other state has 2 (cell bio and ecology), it means the state with less standards can theoretically go into double the depth. On the other hand, the state that covers more standards, if done well, would be giving students a more well-rounded biology education. So really, the issue is in how the standards are balanced with content/skill amount while allowing teachers time for going into the depth needed to cover the learning objectives and not quickly bombard students with quick facts that will likely show up on a test. 

Also, a lot of people are arguing that memorization/recall is useless compared to complex skills, but you can definitely have a standardized test that is mostly complex essay questions requiring deduction, argument, creating models, etc. if you wanted to. My point is, people have an idea of what a typical standardized test is, but states have standardized tests with dramatically different levels of cognitive demand, styles of questions, and also have very different standards that require larger depth and breadth than other states. Many states/tests do fail to get at the higher-level thinking/skills that should be evaluated after taking these classes. But really, the state standards (e.g. Common Core) that teachers follow are the main issue and need to be carefully designed so they can be both taught and assessed effectively.","1446336361"

nerf heal to 200 or increase cd to 10-12 seconds

Soldier76 - I think his ammo should be increase by a bit from 25 to 30 or Increase to 30-35 ONLY when his ult is active

Reaper - his teleport delay time should be buffed, it take likes 2.5-3s to perform the teleport that is a lot of time, should be something like 1s max

Widowmaker - her traps are almost useless and almost no one use it, I think it should at least stun for 1 second or mark that person(and make some kind of noise to you so you know it got triggered even from distance) for a period of time(3s?) so you can use that trap to cover you.

Pharah - increase her reload time a bit.

Symmetra - needs some kind of rework, her ult for me should be like a normal skill, she should be able to build teleports since the beginning of the game with a big cd like 60s or a bit less, make her ultimate be that shield that she gives to allies but with some bonus or just to every near ally just like Lucio's ultimate

Bastion - his shield is just too strong, nerf that from 1000 to 600

I think I started with something like 85 Agility (because H2H dmg is statically calculated and doesn't scale off Strength, like most weapons).

I can punch. *EVERYTHING*. ^still^takes^years^to^kill^anything

I don't get hit much, but I'm pretty glass-cannony, so if something of equivalent or higher touches me, I disappear.

Addressing you questions...

IMO Lover &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thief, but idk. Not sure the math behind it.
Technically every? weapon does well with being able to hit consistently. Some swing faster or have more base damage, but I don't normally get that far into the nitty-gritty. Not sure what the mathematically highest DPS is for the weapon sets. Light Armor is governed by Agility, and there are some really good sets in game (DB, glass, Savior's Hide). Unarmored offers less general protection, but then you aren't weighed down as much (and also is governed by Speed).

Note: ""always"" and ""never"" are very meaningless terms when dealing with RNG, but I kinda get what you mean. ","1446336362"

It was off-putting. I also tutored for ""math for elementary teachers"" and the overall attitude of the class was ""Why are we learning all of this conceptual stuff, when we just have to know how to do it""? SOME students got stuck on questions like ""John accidentally divided by 10 instead of multiplying by 10 on his calculator. John got 14. What should he have gotten""? 10 minutes of conversation later, I realized this COLLEGE student did not even realize that multiplication and division are inverses.

"halo","t5_2qixk","I think bad level design contributes to this. The snow map for example is just almost entirely linear. Whoever controls the fortress (center point) first tends to win.

Yes technically you can back-capture the other armory from the enemy team, but it's a much farther distance to travel if you are the losing team, you have to avoid the winning team's center base, and you are encouraged naturally via the design of the level to assault the fortress above all else.

When it comes to capture based game modes Linear designs are almost always an awful option. Either you have an even number of points and you stalemate forever, or you have an odd number of points and make it super easy for the first team to capture the middle point to win. This is why the subway level in BF3 was easily some of the worst level design in the whole game. The only reason people played it was because it was a massive XP grind with how ""shooting gallery"" the level was designed.

Imagine instead if all three points where semi-equi distant from each other, or at least not arranged linearly. Then there isn't a clear ""You have a massive advantage if you hold this"" point, which prevents steamrolls, and you also encourage players to naturally capture other bases other than the next one in line.","1446336363"

"woahdude","t5_2r8tu","Here's the gist of it.

The sensor in modern digital cameras is really just an array of transistors that adjust output power based on the light hitting them.

We can make transistors run in the range of 10 GHz read/write speeds.

If we set up a sensor reading circuit that captures the whole image in parallel, we can capture the output of the sensor 10 billion (10,000,000,000) times per second.

At that point, two much bigger issues emerge, namely:

* Can we get enough light to form a decent image?
* Will the sensor have too much remaining energy from the previous frame?

As far as light goes, anyone who has worked with extremely slow motion shots, or with extremely short-exposure photography, can tell you that you'll need a lot of it. The solution is basically ""Get more spotlights""

The latent energy in the sensor is an electrical engineering problem. The sensor will drain energy at a given rate, depending on how it is designed. A (very simplified) model would be an [RC circuit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/First_order_RC_circuit.svg).

[Here's a graph of an RC circuit operating in ""overdamped"" mode.](http://faculty.wwu.edu/vawter/physicsnet/topics/dc-current/gifs/Circuits50.gif) Note that the voltage slowly rises up to the final operating point.

[Here's another graph of a sensor operating in ""underdamped"" mode.](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ese206/RLCresponse/Image3.gif)

The damping is determined by the ratio between the resistor and the capacitor. If the resistor doesn't drain fast enough, the voltage will ""bounce"" along the capacitor. If it drains faster, the voltage will take longer to approach 0. *Neither of these states are ideal for most circuits, including image sensors.*

The ideal state is called being ""critically damped"". This means the voltage drains as quickly as possible, and never oscillates. Sensor designers aim for this balance. It sits *between* the overdamped and underdamped states.

(Again, this explanation is extremely oversimplified.)

TL;DR

* Fast digital cameras are limited more by physics and the environment than by the speed of the circuits.
* Slow motion shots need more light than normal shots.
* Camera sensors are designed very carefully for certain electrical characteristics.","1446336363"

The only clone I saw in Episode 3 that I remember was Commander Cody with his helmet off. Stormtrooper's were never supposed to have their helmets off. In the Star Wars Costumes book (http://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Costumes-Brandon-Alinger/dp/1452138052 highly recommend buying this very interesting) Ralph Mcquarrie and Lucas had created stormtroopers to be as McQuarrie put it ""Robot-like. Totally obedient; the ultimate soldier, without any feelings at all. If they were given an order, they did it. So they were better off being these people without expression."" Additionally McQuarrie explains how ""George talked about amking the stormtroopers really like American soldiers in Vietnam, with things chalked on their jakcets, and they would be loaded down with all kinds of equipment. All kinds of mysterious things that you don't know hwat they are; little canisters, like German soldiers wore in World War II.""

So I mean right here you see that storm troopers obviously were never meant to have an expression and I'm kind of surprised DICE, who gloats about an authentic Star Wars experience, would let you remove your helmet.

I think maybe some battle damage armor for customization would be better. Different sorts of battle damage, scratches, blaster grazes, dents, mud, burn marks etc. Or some kind of small color scheme (nothing too extreme) to denote ranks among the storm troopers.

At the same time I'm not too suprised by this since they're letting you use basically any gun you'd like to use even as an imperial whose standard issue blaster is an E-11.

Now homosexuality is mostly hardwired into you and so is pedophilia but its like comparing apples to oranges. It would be more apt to compare pedophiles with people who engage in bestiality. Unlike homosexuals who seek to engage in relations with other consenting adults these other groups seek to engage in relations with people (and animals) who have no real understanding of whats going on. But hey we arent supposed to treat them like [monsters](http://www.salon.com/2015/09/21/im_a_pedophile_but_not_a_monster/) because apparently we are the [monsters](http://www.salon.com/2015/09/30/im_a_pedophile_youre_the_monsters_my_week_inside_the_vile_right_wing_hate_machine/) and we should [help](http://www.salon.com/2015/10/27/the_pedophile_i_could_not_help_he_was_not_a_monster_or_a_molester_the_system_destroyed_him_anyway/) them.

My reference to them (The progressives making this push) ""helping"" the gay community is simply how they latched onto the gay rights movement as a way to push their ideologies over the course of the last decade or so.

Advanced Firing Training is more useful for battleships than cruisers  because battleships can actually shoot down planes without the help of a 40 second ability.

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","Bingo. In the states they're even experimenting with ""by-the-mile"" insurance coverage, so that you're only paying the higher rates when you're on the clock for Uber. It's definitely an added expense that takes a bite of your take-home pay, but unless you're driving full time it's small compared to the cost of renting a taxi plate. And if you're driving full-time, you're likely bringing in the fares to match. Uber doesn't win when the benefits of driving for them are so small as to not be worth their drivers' time. They've changed their rates to optimize around this in the past, and there's no reason to believe they wouldn't do so again in the future.","1446336366"

If so, maybe they're just as valid and the Creator just happens to be the most powerful of all the all-knowing supernatural beings.

It makes sense if rejecting goodness means rejecting goodness and they become beings of pure selfishness.  Whereas humans who do wrong can be redeemed because we still have something worth saving when we reject the Divine plan.","1446336366"

As long as we were there, we knew almost no one, had next to no interaction with the pastors, despite there being so many of them, and strangely enough we couldn't figure out how to get involved at all. I'll also note that I'm fairly confident that pretty much no form of closed communion policy was actually practiced.

Now, after the move, we're at a very small congregation. We know most of the people here, we've got a number of friends we're close with, we see the same 5 or so people every morning for matins, we spend a lot of time with our pastor (which means some solid theological discussion), and Pastor knows everyone who comes to the rail. And to top it all off, the preaching, teaching, and doctrine here are much, much better.

Then you gotta throw out bits of knowledge like you know it all.

The Lions recently fired their Offensive Coordinator, so you can say things like ""These guys have been struggling a lot, but they got a new offensive coach so we could be in a for a good game"". The Lions also have two of the best wide receivers in the league, Calvin ""Megatron"" Johnson (bona fide elite) and Golden Tate (lower top tier at the very least). Be sure to lament the fact that these guys don't get the ball more often, especially Megatron. When they do inevitably get targets and make good plays, other people will agree with you and think you know what you're talking about. The Lions also have pretty decent offensive weapons in Ameer Abdullah (running back) and Eric Ebron (tight end) and their quarterback Matt Stafford is often ranked as above average. Whenever their offensive production performs poorly, say something along the lines of ""Maybe they should have stuck with Lombardi, hahaha!"" in reference to the OC they recently let go who was terrible. If Tate blows up during the game, say something like ""What was Seattle thinking letting him go??""

On the Chiefs side, their quarterback Alex Smith is notorious for his checkdowns. This means that when a few of his receivers run deep routes, he'll frequently choose to throw the ball to the one option target that just runs a very short route. Be sure to call him out on it a lot. It's relatively easy for that checkdown target to get open, which makes it a safe option, but usually hard for them to get any significant amount of yards. When QBs play safe games, they're often referred to as ""game managers"", which doesn't really have any concrete definition, but it's a vague insult that you can freely throw out there. The Chiefs lost their star running back, Jamaal Charles, who was one of, if not *the* best RB in the league when he got injured. Lament the fact they're playing without him a lot, and any time a run play gets stuffed or fails, say something like ""Charles would have found a hole there or broke that tackle"". His replacement, Charcandrick West, has seen relatively little action until two weeks ago when he started. He had a mediocre first game, and then an impressive second game, so be sure to comment on the high variance there. If he starts doing poorly, drop lines like ""Put in Knile Davis!"", the second string guy. The Chiefs also have one of the upper echelon wide receivers in Jeremy Maclin, who recently missed a week due to a concussion, so you can mention that. They also have a really good tight end in Travis Kelce. Again, lament the fact they don't get the ball more often than they do. Golden Tate receives punts (and kicks?) on the Lions team, and he's an incredibly quick and agile runner, so angrily ask why the Chiefs would kick it anywhere near him for him to return. Also, Andy Reid, the head coach of the Chiefs, looks like the Kool-Aid Man (dunno if you have that over there), and he also has a bad history of poor or questionable clock management. If a time out gets called at an odd time, say something like ""Total Reid move."" or ""Classic Andy clock management."", especially during the final two minutes of each half, and doubly especially if they opt to go for another quick play instead of calling time out to preserve time and get set up.","1446336369"

It seems to affect specific people more often than not. I've had mine fog up just a tad bit, but certainly not to the point where I couldn't see my liquid level. It's the inner polycarb layer that likes to get all foggy and iced over.

One thing I can say for sure is we definitely didn't rush it out- we self admittedly take a while to release new products. Makes no sense for us to release crappy stuff, right? It's more likely that it wasn't seen as a big issue or slipped by in our internal testing. 

I hear you. Maybe Mike can come and shed some more meaningful light on the situation.

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","&gt; In the UK emergency medical care is free at the point of service for nationals, without insurance.

The key word being NATIONALS, not foreigners with the exception of other EU citizens because of EU laws. Its free for them because of an EU wide reciprocal agreement that EU citizens are entitled to the same level of healthcare as natives are in their own EU countries. 

&gt; I'm not sure we really want to go down the US route of asking to see people's bank details before sending them an ambulance, or telling people not to call 999 if they need emergency medical treatment but might worry about the cost.

Not going to happen but what is likely to happen which currently doesn't is that after treatment they'll be asked to pay.

&gt; Particularly when it isn't going to save much money.

£200m has been quoted which if you think its not a lot happens to be more than the claims the BMA are making about junior doctors pay cuts. £200m pays for a lot of doctors. £200m is around 40% of all income tax receipts in the UK.","1446336374"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Early Christian theologians like Gregory of Nyssa viewed the soul, not so much as an internal ghost, but rather as something that emerges within the material processes of the human person and gathers it all together into a coherent whole. The idea of the soul has been likened to a relationship existing between the totality of that human person and God, which is not allowed to be torn asunder at death. There is something about this assemblage or aggregate of personhood that emerges in materiality but then transcends it with death. God therefore is not an entity that is radically intervening into the world by individually sending souls down into matter as if by a list, but rather is involved in the process of person-making that is continually unfolding in the material world, bringing it all together.

"math","t5_2qh0n","Note that Beauty has no memory, so all she knows is that she is waking up for one of the six possible interviews (Heads Monday, or Tails Monday, or Tails Tuesday, etc.).

The trick is that this interview is *not* equally likely to be any of the six!

If the coin landed heads, then there's a 100% chance that this interview is Heads Monday, so this interview has a 50% *overall* chance of being Heads Monday.

Or, if the coin landed tails, then there's a 20% chance that this interview is Tails Monday, and a 20% chance that this interview is Tails Tuesday, etc. So, this interview has a 10% overall chance of being Tails Monday, and a 10% overall chance of being Tails Tuesday, etc.

So, if all you know is that you're being interviewed, then you still have a 50% chance that you're in the Heads interview, and a 50% chance that you're in one of the Tails interviews. The fact that there are a bunch more Tails interviews doesn't actually increase the chances that you're in one right now.

(The tricky part is that, if you ran a simulation, these 6 interviews *would* all happen equally often. But that doesn't mean that they're all equally likely from the perspective of a single-experiment participant.)","1446336380"

It's likely that at least 1 INT will occur (Winston + Atlanta is doing good this year intercepting the ball - 8 INT in 7 games).

"WorldofTanks","t5_2s113","The SU-122-44 isn't for everybody. It has poor gun handling and you have to aim with the mediocre penetration. Not to mention it doesn't have a turret either.

BUT if you can get over these faults, it's a fantastic tank. It has armor to reliably bounce 175 pen guns not to mention its ridiculous Russian DPM. It almost has as much DPM as the STB-1, which is three tiers higher! And of course, since it's a Russian TD, it comes standard equipped with a cloaking device.

TL;DR- tier 10 DPM, incredibly high alpha, medium platform, TD camo, what's not to like?","1446336384"

I was stating that just because you teach MMA, that doesn't mean you're going to beat everyone. MMA is a sport, yes those skills transfer into a street fight, but you're not suddenly going to be the best street fighter because you do MMA, there's a difference in no rules and spending your life training with restrictions in a fight.","1446336384"

I know who Blue Team is because of how much time I spend here but even then I didn't realize they were going to be partnered with Chief in H5 until the trailers.

Honestly though, you've got to decide if you are going to let your family make decisions for you about race before you even start something with someone or if you're going to make your own decisions.

Family stuff though isn't something you have to work out immediately out of the starting gate.  We didn't introduce family for over 6 months, so you've got plenty of time to figure it out. I am in a relationship with a guy and we both had abusers in our family, obviously, neither of us had the perfect family that either would have loved to have been accepted into.

You used to be able to live on a single income, maybe not entirely comfortably but enough to allow someone to be at home with any kids, thats nay on impossible now without government help or a very high paid job. This creates heaps of issues regarding childcare costs, lack of role models, lack of formative education.

The biggest mistake i think people make is that they max e instead of Q. If you do that, you won't be able to outtrade him in his e. You can't trade with him until level 3, but at that point, you just get free trade after free trade unless you misplay. The way to trade is to stand on the melees, and if he walks up, do a quick QW AA Q and E their Q as they come out of the shield. Then you retreat to your casters. If you blocked his Q with you e, you can just stand on the casters and use your empowered autos and 3rd q to just win the trade. If you didn;t block his Q, then get rekt. It's a favored matchup, but ironically it is pretty hard to play it. If both players are bad, then Garen just rolls over you, but if you know how to play it, you can slowly but surely win the game after level 3, assuming no jungle pressure. I often win this matchup 80 cs to 30 at 10 minutes.","1446336394"

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","Ability by ability comments:

* **Requirements:** I'd suggest increasing the entry point from level 5 to level 6 or 7, as that's the standard entry point for most PrCs.  I'd remove the requirement that the spells be Magus spells (have it be 2nd level Arcane spells instead), but add the requirement that they have the Magus Arcana class feature.  If they really want to drop three levels in Magus and three levels in a different class, that's their loss of power.

* **Twin Athame:** I'd make activating this ability require a 2nd level or higher spell and the minimum bonus must be +1.  This gets around the possibility of creating a weapon magically that doesn't pierce DR/magic and makes the capstone that much better.

* **Magus Progression and Magus Arcana:** I'd use the wording/method of the [Winter Witch](http://archivesofnethys.com/PrestigeClassesDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Winter%20Witch) PrC's Spells per Day and Winter Witchcraft abilities in regards to this, including their first level in Ghost Blade not counting towards their Magus progression.  Having an additional level (possibly either level 6 or 10) not count is something to consider depending on how it balances out.

* **Sneak Attack:** I'd give this at level 2 and every third level after (so 2, 5, and 8), maxing out at 3d6.  If you want to keep it at every other level, I'd suggest making Sneak Attack an entry requirement at either 2d6 (personal preference, but bumps entry to level 8 without tricks) or 1d6.

* **Trick Athame:** No real comments, but wording needs some work to standardize it regarding trip and I'm not really a fan of the name in relation to the abilities it actually grants.

* **Trackless Step:** Not sure how this ability meshes with the flavor of the class, but I'd move it to level 4 to cover Sneak Attack going to a level 5 ability.

* **Shift:** Firstly, move this to level 6 to cover Sneak Attack moving to 5.  Secondly, progression goes 3/day at level 6 and 5/day at level 9, with no interim 4/day advancement.

* **Uncanny Dodge:** I'd move this to level 7 to cover the hole left by losing the Shift progression and the Magus Arcana going to being tied to Magus level + Ghost Blade level.

* **Efficient Sacrifice:** A good capstone, but I'd include wording (redundant as it may be) that the bonus caps at +5.

General comments:  As written, this PrC is really good and I see little reason for a Magus with the Spellblade archetype not to take it, even if they're not going to focus on dual-wielding athames, since they don't lose much and gain some nifty abilities (Sneak Attack and Shift together are quite powerful).","1446336395"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I foudn the exact opposite, it can be quite challenging, enemies don't stand around waiting like other games and if you get surrounded you can quite easily get stunlocked to death. You can't just mash attack like in DmC type games to get by because enemies often put up guards and will push you back if you over commit to attacking. Some enemies require certain tactics to bring down efficiently, like those with shields, or enemies that have to be trapped in Yrden to be made vulnerable, warewolves that need to be lit on fire or dusted with silver to stop regeneration etc., it's much closer to Dark Souls than any other game I can think of (that isn't also made by FROM). There was also very little fighting between story points except for at the end, a lot of fights you could run around and avoid if you wanted. There were also heaps on no combat quests too.

Combat flows quite well in my experience too, Geralt controls pretty well, the rubber banding of distance cloing is the only real weakness in that it can be a little unpredictable sometimes, but otherwise, targeting is fine perfectly accurate, dodge rolling works exactly as you expect, the whole pirouette and counter attack has a nice flow to it, but you can transition to more forward attacks, signs or changing enemies perfectly well. I'm not sure why you have such toruble with it because the entire game handles exactly as expected for me.

If you were finding it too easy then maybe you just needed to bump up the difficulty? Or maybe you spent too much time in unnecessary fights and became overlevelled (a legit criticism of the game as it can happen pretty easily for more thorough players). Were you paying attention to the level recommendations for quests and enemies? That stuff makes a big difference. If you honestly found it that much of a chore then I guess 99% of video games just aren't for you, because most are the same or worse than TW2/3...","1446336395"

Both. Losing weight is mostly diet, but lifting and running still help a little and help with overall health. It is not a one or nothing thing. Diet, lift weight 2-3 times a week and run 2-3 days a week on your non-lifting days (If you are super over weight, stick with dieting and lifting until you lose enough weight so you don't hurt your knees running).

"rct","t5_2rzsl","Probably the most disappointed I've ever been in a game, RCT1 and 2 were two of my favorite games at that time.  The game initially looked great, especially for 2004, but to me the graphics got old quick and the performance of the game on computers at the time was horrendous.  The RCT community at the time also never really accepted the game so there were few good parks to download, and also no CSO.  The expansion packs seemed to miss the point of the game, and simply expanded instead of improved.

Looking back on it now, RCT3 isn't as bad as I thought it was then, its community has improved the game enough but I still have no desire to ever play it again.  The ""ride the rides"" feature always seemed like a gimmick to me and never added much, especially considering how bad it looked, even back in 2004.  The UI was also just horrible, probably the worst for any major game I have ever played.  RCT1/2 also have extremely dated UIs but even today those are far superior to RCT3's in my eyes, scrolling for 20 mins to find the right object is just silly.  

IMO, I dont really consider it a true RCT title, Sawyer had almost nothing to do with it and it lost a lot of its charm moving to 3D.  Its almost like a big studio copy of a nice independent game that never felt as fleshed out or finished, that used gimmicks to gain appeal and sales.","1446336399"

"FanTheories","t5_2u6rc","This is really awesome and I hope something comes of it. I don't need Jar Jar to be the supreme ruler of the Sith or anything, but just finding out he was working with Palpatine would be good enough for me.

I recently re-watched all the the Star Wars films and I had a similar theory about Jar Jar that kind of looked at all the same beats of the film that this theory does. 

My theory is that Jar Jar was a force sensitive individual who was never found by the Jedi council and was meant to be a sort of foil to Anakin, showing the dangers of leaving a force sensitive person untrained. A big point in The Phantom Menace was that Anakin would have been taken for Jedi training at an early age, but since he lived on a backwater outer rim planet, nobody ever found out about him. 

Which implies that the Jedi have a faulty system for finding other Jedi. It's not like Hogwarts where some magic book just writes down the names of all the force sensitive kids. Plenty of kids slip through the cracks, especially when they live on planets that fall outside of the republic's range. Add to the fact that Anakin is part of the slave class on Tatooine  and you can understand why he slipped through the cracks. 

Meanwhile Jar Jar is part of the Gungan, who are the lower class on Naboo. It's heavily implied in The Phantom Menance that the Gungan are kind of secluded from the rest of Naboo. It's not like they even have representation in the senate until Jar Jar. So it's likely that plenty of Gungan force sensitive kids slipped through the cracks.  There WERE two Gungan Jedi in the EU, but they only popped up when the Empire was starting to come together (and they both turned to the dark side.) 

So my theory is that Jar Jar's bumbling and whatnot are all a result of him being force sensitive but not trained, it's basically made him a big clutz because he can't really control his own power. I think Qui-Gon could sense that Jar Jar was touched with the force and way too old to train to be a Jedi. And it affected his life in a negative way-- the only reason the Jedi came upon Jar Jar was because the other Gungans couldn't stand him and basically banned him from their society. 

So that influenced Qui-Gon's decision to train Anakin. The force had put him on a path to meet two people with force sensitivity, both too old to be trained, but one who was young enough to at least consider it. Then you add the whole virgin birth/prophecy angle and it must have been apparent to Qui-Gon that this child was important. But only because he'd been sort of given a ""lesson"" by the force in Jar Jar. Basically like ""this is what happens when force sensitive kids slip through the cracks, now imagine someone as clumsy as Jar Jar but with the most midichlorians ever.""  ","1446336400"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","The higher you go up, the less air there is and less resistance for a rocket. Airplanes use air to generate lift. They fly in the sweet spot of 30,000 - 50,000 feet where air is less dense to reduce drag, but dense enough to generate lift. Rockets have zero benefit from being in dense air. Straight up is the shortest path from dense air to thinner air. The thinner the air the more energy goes towards making the rocket go faster opposed to overcoming friction. 

Putting something in orbit is hard, not because it's hard to get up there, but because it's hard to go fast enough to stay there. 90% of a rockets job is to push the ship fast enough to stay in orbit. The remaining 10% is getting it up high enough. Other wise we would just strap stuff to high altitude balloons and use a tiny rocket to put it in orbit, but that is clearly not the case.","1446336402"

"TimberAndStone","t5_2vbl6","Don't think the variety of food matters much. But the industrial crops are pretty important. My current build was primarily carrots for a while... One farmer I find will generally keep your eight guys alive, but not really provide growth. And that's only assuming he's not level one to start out. Their skills most certainly seem to affect the speed at which they work. Not sure about people starving... Have not had that issue. I guess be sure you've constructed some food storage crates/barrels?

But yea a higher level miner definitely works faster, and I assume the same is true of all professions. Stone tools should work fine until you have a defense sufficient to repel attacks brought on by the pursuit of higher tech. To answer your question, I would say 'when you are confident in your ability to defend yourself'. Your first higher level tools aught to be weapons too IMO.

The unit menu is accessed with ""u"".

You indeed do need a lot of food. My strategy here is to initially pursue suitable defenses (trench, then walls) above all else. A single farmer, maybe a forager set to berries. I purposefully avoid rushing into anything that's not needed in the pursuit of defenses, so as to keep my wealth as low as possible. After the wall is done I pursue military training, then establish things like tailoring/herding/etc, then throw my mining crew (and anyone else who's idle) into farming. This should eventually lead to a decent food surplus. After that you just keep two or three dudes farming (higher level farmers are way more efficient) and make sure you have enough farmland defined to keep them busy.

Eh, you have plenty of time for that.

There are 168 hours in a week. You need to sleep ~8 hours a day, so that leaves 112 hours a week for non-sleep activities.

Work/school for 40 hours a week means you have 72 hours left in your week to do whatever you please.

If you can't manage to study/work out/eat/commute in that time and still have a few hours to play with there is something seriously wrong with you.

&gt;Your flair says Alberta so I'm inclined to believe you aren't aware of crazy rent/living costs in most cities

Rent in Calgary is(even after the oil price collapse and the subsequent loss of jobs and movement of people) still $1,100 a month for a 1 bedroom apartment outside of the city centre. Residence prices for out universities are a bit better- the cheapest residence fees at the U of C are $6,389 per school year, which is a bit less than living on your own. Mount Royal runs ~$5,000 rent for their residence. 

Rent in Waterloo is ~$735 a month outside the city centre, with the school year rates at the university of Waterloo sitting at a low of $5,166. 

https://uwaterloo.ca/housing/fees-contracts/residence

http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=Canada&amp;city=waterloo

http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=Canada&amp;city=Calgary

http://www.ucalgary.ca/residence/placestolive/rates2015

So I have no idea how that's ""crazy rent/living costs"" when in reality it's *cheaper* to live in the same conditions at certain Ontario schools.

Obviously rent prices are going to be higher in cities like Montreal, Vancouver, and Toronto- but in all seriousness if you can't afford to live there *don't go to those schools*.

&gt;This assumes that you're going to a school that allows you to pick out the perfect schedule. Not every course will cooperate.

Most schools require you to take 4-6 courses per semester in order to qualify for ""full time student"" status. Most schools also offer night classes(so you can work during the day).

This *generally* means that you can, provided you stay on top of your schedule, find some way of making a work schedule work with your school schedule.

You can compress your courses into 2-4 days and work the rest of the week, work the weekends and one other day, work every day of the week and take night classes, etc etc. 

It's really, really not challenging to do this. The only time you would have an issue is if you had a class at different times every weekday.","1446336406"

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","&gt; What are Living Stories and how do I do them?

Living World Season 1 is not replayable because of how it was constructed (open-world events, large-scale group content etc). Season 2 is split into eight episodes, which you needed to be active when they were released to play for free. They can be bought from the gemstore, though. Essentially they're a series of short story snippets bridging the gap between the original Personal Story and the Heart of Thorns story.

&gt;Are Masteries HoT only?

Yep. You can earn the points but can't spend them unless you upgrade to the expansion.

&gt;Is the action camera HoT only? Really wanted to try it out, but didn't see an option. 

Nope, look harder. Got to set a keybind to activate it in the settings menu.

&gt;Did they get rid of Skill Point events/quests? I remember doing a few in the beta, but haven't seen any yet. 

Skill points are now 'hero points'. It's the same exact thing, except you can't spend them on Mystic Forge stuff and you don't get extra for levelling up post-80 now.

&gt;Should I be crafting as I go, or should I simply wait until I'm closer to 80 and do a bunch at once? (Is crafted gear better than karma/vendor gear throughout most of the game?) 

While levelling, the best way to get gear is probably just to buy it off the TP every ten levels or so. I personally find crafting pre-80 a bit of a waste (unless doing it for XP), especially as I now have every discipline at 400+. Your choice, though. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯","1446336409"

"artificial","t5_2qhfb","Computers are good at different things than animals (including humans).

The point isn't really that we should be making cockroach-AI (although some people argue that we should), but rather that we can't. And that's a shortcoming of AI: a goal to work towards. 

Whether comparing AI to intelligence levels of animals makes sense depends a bit on what route we take to get to human-level (and above) AI. It's possible that the last piece of the puzzle instantly boosts AI from sub-cockroach to super-human levels, in which case the comparison wasn't really helpful.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I’d raise my auto-liability insurance to at least $1 million. I’d read it carefully to make sure that it would still pay out in the event of punitive damages, if it came to that, with a company other than State Farm or All State. I’d tell the person who wanted that $1 million that, “This is gonna hurt a little, but it’s the only way I think you may get that million bucks.” 

We’d arrange a situation whereupon I get shitfaced drunk, run into his car and then pull him out of the car and punch him a few times. We could find some corrupt shrinks and doctors (and these are easier to find than one may think) to issue the follow diagnoses: a permanent disability rating in the hip or knee of at least and post-traumatic stress disorder severe to the point that it prevented him or her from returning to work for the foreseeable future. 

I’d also tell this person to tell the liability investigator something like, “Well, my attorney says I probably shouldn’t talk to you, but do you I think I should?” 95% of the time, the investigator will know better and say no. But, they may be stupid or arrogant and try to get away with that, which is a big no-no.

Double Jeopardy states that you cannot try a person for the same crime in both state and federal court.

That shows us that Luffy has matured and is more careful even though he's playful most of the time. And when before he really declared war on Big Mom, he offered her the treasure and that shows us again his development as a captain.

EDIT: When the Straw Hats entered Gycorde Plaza on Fishman Island and the Fishmen asked whether they're their ally or enemy and he answered t they have to decide that is another great example for Luffy's growth. And when he said that he doesn't want to be a hero because he's a pirate showed us in a comedic way that he has grown.




[SPOILER FOR ANIME WATCHERS]

* Translate your facial expressions into VR

My board has sadly been incapacitated since summer though, so I've gotten a regular one to ride on until I can get my boosted fixed. That has been a wonderful learning experience as well and I really recommend getting a regular in order to understand what riding un-boosted is about (balancing and steering with only one foot on the board since you're pushing with the other) and learn proper footbreaking. I tried practising footbreaking on my boosted, but was usually to lazy to do it enough to make progress. Also the trucks are a lot tighter on a boosted than a regular board in order to make it more stable at higher speeds, which I actually thinks makes it a bit harder to footbreak, since you can't steer the board as easily by shifting weight between the outer in and inner side of the foot you still got on the board.","1446336426"

"slashdiablo","t5_2sv1q","With an ice in a +3 xbow skills mb you want to aim for 75 ias.

Cleverindividual hit the spot on the build, but you can always mix things up by using a different armor (I use tyraels for the visuals personally), you can use an ormus if you want more +cold damage though you usually won't need any. 

You can use xbow gcs for more damage, but the general consensus is that cold damage scs are better because the cold damage scs will have a longer freeze length period.

Merc can be an infinity merc so you can pierce through their cold quicker for more damage, but if you're really lazy about chugging mana you can use an insight merc.

Res isn't a necessary to have at maxed only because you don't often get up close enough to get hurt, but if you want the cushion then feel free to aim for 75 in hell. Valk + merc should be more then enough to help tank.

As for dealing with cold immunes it'll either be your merc and you can even skill points into magic arrow.

skill order generally is this:

20 frozen arrow

20 cold arrow

d/a/e if you want.

Pierce to 69% w/ razortail so you can hit the 99

I have pentrate maxed, but you don't really need to

After that you generally have a lot of skill points left over, you can skill into magic arrow, or even explore into exploding arrow. 

You don't need to skill ice arrow, it's negligible what it provides. cold damage scs provide a longer freeze length period.

If you want, I have access to two ice maidens if you want to take a look into it.","1446336427"

You're giving him the benefit of the doubt, had that been Costa for example you'd have seen it differently.

If you watch it back he was more than capable of jumping over Navas and fully clearing him, instead he didn't even open into a full stride, didn't come anywhere near to fully extending his left leg, and somehow managed to make contact with Navas' face and hand when he came down.

Watch it back, I think he deliberately 'left one on him', and tried to conceal it making it appear accidental, much like Costa does, who's very much the expert in that kind of snidery.","1446336432"

And when a hot girl tells you she's been ""alone"" for two years that's a good time to tease her about the men she's been ""alone"" with, and tell her it's her l lucky day cause now you're here. So she's not alone anymore.

Women always have another man lined up. Even if it's just in her head. Women are basically never ""alone"".  There's always some guy.  If you want something more serious than an easy lay tell them that you aren't going to be competing with that other guy. When they say who just look at them and tell them they know who you are talking about.

Hot women always have options. You've just got to have options back. That way once she fucks another dude or starts giving it to much shit you can just slide into the next girl.","1446336433"

Why would you invade so many areas when you are fighting a defensive war? Especially when you have so many defensive advantages.

The US can't deal with a siege scenario,  we'd run out of rare earth metals and the population couldn't stand rationing for that long

&gt; You also didn't tell me how the world invades and defeats the US.

The longer the war lasts, the less relative manpower the US has and the less tech and hardware advantage they have

&gt; You are wrong because the world gets bogged down fighting American guerillas and gives up. America then invades the rest of the world and wins cause 'merica.

My point was that the only way for the US to nullify the chance of invasion is to force a surrender, that would either require some sort of weapon I can't think of or crippling the major powers","1446336438"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;pouring more money into a marketing budget is a better ROI than increasing product quality or reducing product price.

But why is that a fault of capitalism? If people were dissatisfied with quality or price they wouldn't purchase that item and opt for the other available alternatives. I struggle to blame to company for marketing something that people are choosing to buy in massive quantities- especially when many alternatives exist.

&gt;Marketing doesn't really increase quality of life

I could name an incredibly large amount of people that marketing increases quality of life for. Consumers, for one, obviously have made a conscious decision that the utility they receive from purchasing a marketed product exceeds their costs. By definition, that is an improvement in value for a consumer. A vast majority of products we use every single day are marketed. Without marketing many of the companies that make these products would cease to exist. 

&gt;The solution isn't to 'ban' marketing but to tax it in order to re-calibrate the ROI trade off between legitimate innovation and better marketing, in order to encourage the creation of better products or more efficient production.

How do you propose taxing marketing? Given that the ROI on marketing is positive, the govt. receives more tax dollars from the income earned on the goods sold because of marketing than the govt. would from taxing marketing expenditure at the same rate. Additionally, the ability to mass-market a product is precisely the reason that innovation occurs. Why would you invest in R&amp;D if you don't think that you would see a return on your investment? What makes that return positive? The ability to market that product in order to get it into the hands of thousands/millions of people. Marketing ONLY makes sense if you have a product that is innovative in some way. The two are directly related. We don't see people marketing commodities or undifferentiated products. An innovation does no good for anyone if it sits on the shelf because people don't know about it.

This whole notion of ""fixing the ROI on marketing"" is frankly just a confusing argument. Are you advocating that we make marketing artificially more expensive? Or that companies make less money? Those are the only two ways to change the ROI. It just doesn't make any sense in our current economic system, or any economic system that could exist in America in the distant future.

Most people will tell you that the next bigger wheels are either the Logitech G25/27 and they are right but Thrustmaster as recently released the T150 which looks like it could rival the low end Logitech wheels. Probably my next upgrade.

You probably get allot of suggestions about other stuff you can buy like better pedals or mods for those but my recommendation is start with the wheel and get into the game first.

Ever since the religion died out, the official name for earth has been the name of that goddess, hence Tellus. It may seem like a petty distinction (and yes I get that you're being sarcastic) but it's kind of an important distinction if wanting to make fun of someone using a name incorrectly, while using other names incorrectly.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Well, first of all, this is a Soviet SAM platform. It was designed to be used by conscripts, not highly trained professionals. It does require training to use, though. 

The rebels were trained by Russian military. They may have even had some Russian reserve soldiers man some of the battery. But they shot down a passenger plane because they used the Buk system improperly and only relied on a single signature. The Buk is designed to be used as in an array with two vehicles acquiring a single target. That not only assists with acquisition and guidance, but it gives a multi-directional radar signature. That would have made it obvious that it was a target the size and shape of a passenger plane. Fully trained operators in a regular military command structure would not have made that mistake. 

The rebels weren't trained completely or properly so they shot down a passenger plane with a Russian weapon. Not even Western powers accuse the actual Russian military of firing the missile. They all accuse the pro-Russian militants. ","1446336444"

Same thing if you find any map empty, you still have to do a ton of walking between area's of mobs, let alone party grinding outside of doing dungeons. I haven't seen anywhere that I would actually need a full party to spawn kill the mobs. Only reason I even parties is so we deter solo players from the area.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Sure! Be ready for questions and willing to answer them. We don't much like door-to-door evangelists reading from a script. Be prepared for criticism. We don't much like *nonsense*, either, and your cows are not sacred to us.

"reddevils","t5_2rxse","To put it simply possession football is used to manipulate the opponent into leaving their space and drawing them out so that you can use that space to your advantage.
I.e another player moves into that space so he can receive a pass and maybe get off a shot or create a chance.

You can also use it to tire out teams that press high up the pitch and exploit their tiredness during the first or second half.

This is basically a very simplified version of what possession football is.

You can read up more on it and it may help you understand what LVG is trying to do.","1446336450"

Alternately, simply stick to ciders or flavored beers / non-beers. There's alcoholic ginger beer, root beer, honey porter, chocolate stout, and various spiced seasonal ales to choose from if traditional beer doesn't do it for you. My personal favorite is Strongbow.

A couple of other things you can work in there if you want: You can change the direction of the conversation if you don't feel in control of it by saying ""To be honest, this is something I've wanted to tell you for a long time, but you are so nice, that I never could figure out how to end the bible study.""

That makes it clear that this isn't a sudden change.

Also, you can say, ""Look, I like you guys. You're nice and friendly and we get along. I'd really love to go to the movies with you or get dinner sometime - we can be friends - I just don't want to study the bible with you.""

They probably won't ever take you up on that offer of just being regular friends. JW's don't do that - they're not regular friends with people who aren't also JW's. But the thing is, if this were a normal relationship, there's no reason you all couldn't continue hanging out. By saying that, it's reasserting normalcy and it's steering the conversation away from religion.","1446336457"

I am a firm believer that the market dictates things far more efficiently than government, including funding education. My far-right mind would suggest lowering taxes on universities/colleges to increase competition in both standard of education and affordability. Whether or not that would help is theoretical. 

I would also like some more practical education in high-schools as we already fund that anyway. Maybe teach things about personal finance (my favorite topic so this is bias), teach people that they don't necessarily need a degree to get a good job, or maybe even that real estate isn't always a great investment. 

I most certainly agree that an educated workforce is better, I just don't believe that the best means of doing so is government funded.  ","1446336459"

"bipolar","t5_2qnv4","I went up to 400 mg of Lamictal this year after a month of mania left me in a really bad place.  I talked to my doctor about it, basically said I knew I wasn't maxed out on the drug and that while 200 mg was more the norm for bipolar patients I've always been the person that needed high doses of everything.  He agreed, and we talked about how epileptic patients sometimes take even more than 400 mg so we raised it.  

It does seem to be helping.  If you can, get a second opinion.  Especially if it seems to make an immediate difference, you may only need to go to 300 mg or even 250 mg if you're taking the higher dose every day.  For me it took a little while to pull me out of the depression I was in, but it worked when nothing else would, and when most everything else would have been too dangerous to even try (I can't take antidepressants of any kind for example).","1446336460"

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; The diversity in the US for most of its history was due to people from differing European nations emigrating, which are not very dissimilar from each other.

The US has people in it from all over the world.  In every major city in the nation you can find food from almost anywhere in the world.  There are people from all 4 corners of the earth living in harmony in my city alone, and there are places all around that represent this, from Mosques where Muslims pray, to Jewish temples.  From Chinatown to Russian Orthodox dances.

In spite of diversity?  Are you mad?  We embrace diversity and it has made us the absolute leaders of globalization.  We are the octupus that seeks to bind the world.  Our understanding of other cultures and acceptance of differences has changed the world, i would say for the better.

There are several factories in my city that have a great number of people from all over working in them.  Vietnamese 2nd generation managers oversee work from Somali refugees alongside Guatemalans.   

&gt;The diversity in the US for most of its history was due to people from differing European nations emigrating, which are not very dissimilar from each other.

They were different enough to go to war for centuries there..  but managed to get along here.  Our great experiment, Ellis Island is *absolutely celebrated for it's diversity*. 

I'm not sure where you think you live, but the USA is an extremely culturally diverse place.  North Africans farmed our south for a century, and Chinese built the fucking railroads.  To say that we are homogenous and mostly European is disingenuous to the hodgepodge we are.  It's whitewashing our history.  It's wrong.","1446336462"

Intelligence is somewhat different. It is the ability to create new knowledge. The ability to derive new information. Be able to see the connection to what may appear to be disparate information.

That being said, knowledge helps express intelligence. Without that initial knowledge to use, there can be no deriving of new knowledge beyond what is immediately in front of you.","1446336463"

1) Steam downloads a small delta patch. This contains the changes in a file  
2) Steam then reads the orginal file and the patch file, and creates the new version  
3) STeam tehn writes this new file to your game directory  

Depending on teh game, it may spend a lot of time writing the output file. For example, a patch file might only be 50 MB large, but has to patch a 3 GB file. Downloading the file will be fast, but actually re-creating that 3GB file will take awhile.

"SLO","t5_2r3yh","SLO-Op is great. Indoor bouldering with 24/7 access for members at $45/mo. for a minimum of 3 months. You can try it out for $10 admission on certain nights - check the website when you can do this - to find out if it's for you. 

If you're a Poly student, the bouldering area outside of the rec is pretty fun. You just grab a wristband from Poly Escapes and climb for as long as you want - until they close the climbing area. Far less area to work with so only so many routes you can work on, but it's an awesome way to spend a break from classes or studying.

If you want to boulder or climb outdoors, Bishop's Peak has some great boulders like ""Boulder in the Woods"" and ""Clarissa"" both are pretty fun. I'm sure there are more but I have only bouldered those two.

 For trad/top rope climbing, there are a few different walls (Cracked Wall, Garden Wall, etc) on Bishop's with some super fun routes if you have the gear or know someone who does. 

They're working on rebolting some of the routes so a few aren't available at the moment but most of them are still there. Lots of variety as far as ratings, too. 

I don't climb a ton, but these are all spots that I've climbed. They're all a bit different but I've had fun at all of them.","1446336471"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Well, for what it's worth, I spent far too much of my grade school life taking tests.  I'm talking academic test-taking competitions.  Let me tell you what I found were most conducive to test-taking:

1. SAT (old version with 2 subjects): Learn how to spot the ""trick"" answers. Eliminate two answers and the odds are in your favor if you guess. If you can't answer the question, find patterns in the answer choices.

2. ACT: Read fast. The test is designed to be difficult to finish, so being a fast reader is a huge benefit.

3. In general: if you're comfortable taking tests, it's easier because you don't freeze up under pressure the way other students do.  Learn how to figure out not what you believe is the right answer to the question but the answer the test writer was looking for. 

That's what ""teaching to the test"" involves learning. You're no longer simply learning the material; you're learning *the skill of taking tests.*

The skills I learned that made me a good test taker really didn't matter when I went on to get my undergraduate engineering degree (except in some bio classes and orgo). They didn't matter at all when I got my Ph.D.  As a researcher, I can say that the test-taking mindset is the polar opposite of the mindset that is needed in the creative world:

Instead of short-term learning, you need long-term retention.

Instead of working quickly without assistance for a short time, you need to work steadily, recognize when to request assistance, and do so for months.

Instead of learning subject A separate from subject B, you should understand how the subjects interact.","1446336471"

Battlefield 3 has a genuinely shitty campaign, and you listed one of the biggest reasons why; the plot is completely secondary to the gameplay. Rather than write a clever plot that gives you proper motivation to shoot different types of enemies throughout the campaign, they wrote a story that is entirely independent of their game design goals. The result is nonsensical stuff like shooting the French police, as you mentioned, because the plot calls for you to be in France and the game calls for you to have bad guys to shoot in the face.

"acne","t5_2qse3","If your skin is naturally oily, let it be. Acne can be caused by an excess of oil (caused by under-moisturizing or over-cleansing) that together with dead skin cells clogs pores, but oil itself does not cause acne. You shouldn't worry about feeling oily. 

It's important to moisturize because acne likes to be wet. It becomes irritated when it is dry, and heals in wet environments. 

Apply clindoxyl in the morning so it's on all day. It can only work when it is on your skin. You shouldn't do anything after school. If you want, you can gently rinse and moisturize afterwards, but nothing more. 

These are not little changes in the scope of your skin and its cells. Moisturizing just once more a day can greatly improve your skin, especially since you are under-moisturizing most days. You don't need a complete overhaul. You just need to use the tools you already have correctly.

If you really want to help fade dark marks that appear after acne, and just want better skin in general, use sunscreen everyday!! 

If 6 weeks+ goes by and you see little improvement, look into different acne medications and a dermatologist.","1446336472"

"buildmeapc","t5_2t7ly","When building HTPC AMD offers better price/performance ratio in the low tiers and offers vastly superior integrated graphics. Their R7 on die graphics with AMD A8 and A10 are absolute perfection for an HTPC, and their low cost quad cores make for a very responsive computing experience on a budget. Intel dual cores and Intel integrated graphics can feel sluggish in many applications in comparison. Intel doesn't really offer much useful products until you start looking at i5 which is overkill for an HTPC unless you want it to be a 1080p 60 fps gaming HTPC (which is perfectly doable but more expensive :P)

Where AMD runs into problems is comparing them to i5 and i7, because those CPUs have vastly superior instruction per clock than AMD's best octo cores, which is an important stat for pushing high fps high detail gaming. Intel runs the field in $200+ CPUs. If you want a good gaming PC, the lowest CPU you should be buying is an i5 4590 or i5 6500. Ideally you want an i5 6600k. AMD doesn't have a similar product right now to compete with those, which is where they catch a lot of flak.

It really doesn't though. It is 100% dependent on the mother. It does not have the necessities to survive on it's own. ","1446336475"

So hopefully, this is just a temporary situation. However, since you are concerned now, talk to your mom. Tell her you want to find ways to spend time with your dad (especially in the few years before you head off to college), but don't know how would be the best way to go about doing that given his work schedule. She can probably figure out a good compromise at this time. 

FWIW-- this exact situation is why I am on the fence about having kids. My job tends to be similar at times when big stuff is going on, and I'd rather not be the workaholic parent that is the ""bad guy"" in kids movies. ","1446336475"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Dear reddit, you sadden me. Germany, as well as Sweden, lives up to the same resolutions signed by all western countries after the second world war - you HAVE to open your borders to refugees, and if you're in doubt about whether or not they're 'real' refugees, you're obliged to house them until their case has been run. 

Germany of all countries, cannot run from this obligation (like so many other western countries), both due to a strong national feeling of order, and their own history.

I find it sickening to see so many of you dear redditors jumping on a muslim hatetrain, without even considering who and what these people are fleeing from - the result of several middle eastern wars involving the US and several European countries. We created this shit, we didn't finish a thing over there, and yet we hate the people fleeing from daily bombings, risking their life to reach a better place.

Yes, I do agree that some of these people aren't refugees, but using anecdotal evidence of this to support a dehumanizing hate of these refugees, is wrong on so many levels. The majority seems to be refugees, we agreed to help refugees back in 1946, and I applaud Germany for sticking to that agreement - while we see so many other countries backing out due to the refugees having another religion (while fleeing from the very people they're being painted as).","1446336476"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Its Reddit, so I'm sure you'll get plenty of responses from people who don't believe in gender roles. With respect to them, and without trying to disparage their views, let me give the perspective of someone who *does* believe in gender roles:

She moved on so easily for two reasons 1) she's a go-getter masculine type. She's more in control of her emotions and 2) being a woman she probably has more people out there willing to be with her.

You're a man, and there is a significantly smaller pool of women who are willing to date submissive, effeminate men. I don't think you're stuck being this way. I don't think you're submissive by nature. Depression and anxiety breed emotional neediness because of the nature of both conditions. Depression is the illusion that you're not truly loved by those around you. Anxiety is the illusion that you're in a constant state of danger. In both cases, the only thing that temporarily alleviates the pain is receiving tons of comfort from other people. 

That's not very fair for anyone who tries to date you. No person can give you enough comfort and love to help you with your depression because depression and anxiety cause your worldview to be warped. Those illusions will constantly try to justify their existence even in the presence of a loving SO/family/friends/etc.

You brought up gender roles, which makes me think that you're a bit insecure about your masculinity. Like you're blaming your lack of adherence to traditional gender roles for the very different reactions you two had to the breakup.

I think you should see someone for your depression and anxiety issues. Professional help. I think that when the depression fog disappears it'll be easier for you to accept that you and your ex are very different people and therefore it only makes sense that you each had your own unique reactions to breaking up.","1446336484"

The main benefit of full dex is the fact that crits get a 1.5x damage multiplier, though. If anything you'd want to put some early points into STR to level faster, and then go full DEX later on when your skills are doing higher base damage.

"afinil","t5_2xzvv","In Australia (so FDA isn't really important), anyway I didn't get it prescribed. I used modafinil as a nootropic. I noticed without it I got excessively tired, I am halfway through being diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia. People close to me didn't notice an issue, and that's because I've been surviving off modafinil and caffeine for a while.

I don't know if my early age of having it caused it, or if I've had it develop and I was just lucky I stumbled upon it early. It was probably not the best decision to make, but yeah.

In Australia without being ""fully diagnosed"" (we've got ""free""ish healthcare) modafinil costs $110 for 30pills (only 100mg also). Once I've finished all my tests I can apply and get it at normal PBS price about $13AUD (reduced gov subsidized price), but they'd rather give me dex at the same price (for 100pills vs 30 modafinil pills) as it's cheaper in the long run. But yeah my sleep specialist isn't really a modafinil fan, he hadn't even heard of armodafinil either.

Feel free to pm/reply I'm happy to explain further the TGA (Aus FDA) page on modafinil is [Here](https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/servlet/xmlmillr6?dbid=ebs/PublicHTML/pdfStore.nsf&amp;docid=168497&amp;agid=%28PrintDetailsPublic%29&amp;actionid=1)","1446336489"

I've done everything right - have a restraining order, getting counseling, living with family. But after the initial shock wears off your friends and family move on and you are still stuck in this numbness that erupts into crying fits every once in awhile.

I was already depressed in my relationship, and from my extremely stressful job. Thankfully I don't have the stress of the relationship and his demands and emotional abuse bearing down I me, but the stress from work and the emotional toll from trying to get through every day without breaking down is hindering my recovery. 

I can't trust anyone, so it is just me, myself, and I every day. Sometimes I really enjoy being by myself, others I am utterly desperate for someone to just hold me and tell me everything's okay and that I'm a good person.

After being put through the manipulation wringer, I never am quite sure what is real and what is not, even with my own thoughts and feelings.

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","&gt;  purchasing power is based on borrowing ability ...House prices should *only* be based on income.

Oh, for pete's sake - how ignorant and presumptuous can you *get*? 

I've lived in Vancouver since 1986. I'm about to retire, and my income, therefore my borrowing power, will both be considerably reduced. However, when the sale of my business at retirement is added to my life savings, I will have built up a considerable net worth over the course of my working life. In fact, enough to purchase outright a second, moderately priced piece of Vancouver real estate.

Are you actually proposing that I should be *forbidden* from buying a second home with all the money I've accumulated throughout my life, because my ""purchasing power"" should be arbitrarily tied to my greatly reduced borrowing ability? 

Are you saying that my high net worth should be irrelevant when it comes to my ability to buy property? Are you saying that due to my low retirement income, it should somehow be made *illegal* for me to upsize or downsize my existing home? To buy a rental income property? To buy a small studio condo for my child to live in while they attend SFU? That I should be forbidden from engaging in any other local real-estate transaction, simply because I would be using exclusively my own, hard-earned money to do so - rather than fruitlessly seeking a loan based exclusively on the slim income that my RRIF will provide me?

All this completely artificial obstructionism, simply because *you* have arbitrarily decreed that ""housing prices should be based exclusively on income""? Not *everybody* needs to finance their purchase, you know, or to have income in order to buy. Are you not aware that nearly half of all Canadian homeowners - 47% - already have title to their homes free and clear? What purchasing rules are you proposing for those people, whose numbers lie literally in the *millions*?

Lots of Vancouver buyers, both Canadian and foreign, are in exactly the same situation as I am: they've worked hard all their lives and have managed to accumulate sufficient net wealth over the years to purchase outright. Are you suggesting they should be legislatively locked out of the market with your stupid and completely arbitrary ""conditions for purchase,"" by tying their ability to buy exclusively to their income? And how, exactly, do you propose to *regulate* that? 

How bloody self-entitled and presumptuous of you.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","Bringing up the definition again.  
&gt;create a powerful effect that either wins the game immediately or creates a situation that subsequently leads to a win.  
  
Any 2+ combo that leads to a win, regardless of amount of turns it takes to get there, fits the combo deck definition. ""But this and that combo in any deck can lead to a win!"", yes but they're not always the same few combos. Every CP game revolves around using set combos to win.  
You can set up a win condition with just a Twisting Nether, but 1 card =/= Combo.  
  
&gt;You have multiple options, and combo finisher is just a nice thing to have, not a necessity. Unlike FM.  
  
Which cards are a necessity in FM again? Honestly without removing the whole deck I don't see it. Is the point that you need to use more than one card to win the game? Isn't that true of any deck?  
You can also remove all the threats in a CW without the Warrior playing badly. What at most the deck will have 7-8 late game cards? A mage can have much more single target removal than that, with a lot of multi-card or multi target removal mixed in.  
  
&gt;If so then yes, they fit the description, why not.  
  
Because if it was true that'd mean Annoyotron = Ysera.  
  
&gt;That's you who tried to argue that since Control definition reads ""powerful cards"" not ""powerful creatures"" FM is somehow control. I just pointed out that Combo definition also mentions ""powerful cards"".  
  
Your entire argument for control warrior being control and FM not being it is ""it has more late game cards, you don't lose if they kill alex/grom/ysera"", so what? Having more stuff to deal with is suddenly the distinction between control and not control?","1446336501"

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","Do you have endometriosis or adenomyosis? Both of these diseases can cause terrible periods (among many other symptoms like fatigue, bladder and bowel issues, pain with sex, infertility, pain in the pelvis, lower back, hips, rear, thighs, nausea/vomiting, etc), and often go undiagnosed by doctors for years because there is a huge lack of awareness and accurate information about them in the general population AND medical communities. 

I completely sympathize with your pain because my periods are hell, too, and I lost my last job due to needing too much time off work because of the pain and fatigue from endo. I had friction with my boss in my prior job, too, because I had to call out once a month for my period. She thought I was exaggerating my pain, but I was one of their best workers so she didn't want to fire me. I have considered emailing her since to tell her there really was something wrong with me, even though stupid drs kept telling me I was fine!

It took me 6 years to finally get diagnosed because so many MDs are dismissive of menstrual pain when they shouldn't be, and the only way to 100% diagnose endo is through laparoscopic surgery and biopsy. I hope you don't have endo or adeno, but it may be something worth looking into because it is NOT normal to suffer every month. 

Many OB/Gyns do not have enough skill or knowledge to correctly treat the disease, so specialist care is often needed. That's where I'm headed next, since hormonal treatments and ablative surgery didn't work for me.

"iamverysmart","t5_2yuej","The defining characteristic of a psychopath is their inability to care about what others feel. So first of all, not all psychopaths are violent. They will only be violent if they 1) actually find it pleasant to inflict physical pain on others or somehow think it will help them ease their emotional cravings, 2) they feel they can get away with it. Secondly, even violent ones will usually never tell you what they are about, precisely because psychopaths are so good at hiding their true nature.

On the other hand, it is well known that psychopaths have an unusual capacity to focus on very narrow and intense tasks once they see the opportunity for gain in it, material or of some other sort. In fact, they usually will take an uber-pragmatic, fully task oriented approach to it and base all their decisions on maximizing their own gain.

"mtgmarketwatch","t5_35mx0","Lets see here, there have been a lot of good suggestions here but no ""lists"". I play almost exclusively modern/legacy/limited, so basically I trade all of my limited fodder into eternal playsets. So I've got more-or-less a playset of everything good for modern/legacy and it makes it really easy to keep playing and grow my collection over time. The fact that Snappy now costs $80 would be irrelevant if you picked them up on the cheap at rotation. It's a great strategy IMO for building a long-term collection.

So lets make a list of all the eternal playable / good pickups (IMO) and I'll update with replies / other cards I think of. Including Theros because they should still be floating around in peoples' trade binders

Theros

* (1x each) the Gods, Thoughseize, Swan Song, Sylvan Caryatid, Anger of the Gods, Ashiok, Xenagos, Nykthos, Temples

Born of the Gods

* (1x each) the gods, Brimaz, spirit of the labyrinth, Searing Blood, Kiora, Springleaf Drum, temples

Journey into Nyx

* (1x each) the gods, Keranos (actually eternally playable), Eidolon of Rhetoric, Eidolon of the Great Revel, Nyx-Fleece Ram, Ajani, Mana Confluence, Temples

KTK

* Jeskai Ascendancy, 5x Charms, Siege Rhino, Murderous Cut, Monastery Swiftspear, Become Immense, Seeker of thte Way, Dig Through Time (only if dirt cheap though), Treasure Cruise, Tri-Lands, Sarkhan, Sorin, (1x) Ugin's Nexus, fechlands (only AFTER rotation at this point).

FRF

* **Tasigur, Soulfire Grand Master, Monastery Mentor, Ugin

Dragons

* (1x each) the Dragonlords, Dromoka's Command, Kolaghan's Command, Atarka's Command, Rending Volley, Anafenza, Narset, Sarkhan, Haven of the Spirit Dragon

Origins

* Jace (wait until rotation), all the otehr planeswalkers, Abbot of Keral Keep, Day's Undoing, Piledriver, Vortex, Languish

BFZ

* Ulamog, Void Winnower, Manlands, Blue retreat, sylvan scrying","1446336504"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Yeah, at first I was pissed off... why are you teaching us MIPS? In the real world, x86 is going to be a lot more useful.

But now I understand completely why MIPS is used. It's all the same in the end. You can pick up most ASM languages extremely quickly by knowing something like MIPS. It's the most approachable, and actually is huge in the real world too. It's up there, near x86 and ARM, whether people know it or not. It was a huge market and it still is, just not in your desktop, but likely in your router.

And really, it puts you in a great spot if you want to use it at work. If you're writing ASM for work, you'll likely be doing it for embedded devices, and I'm betting there's a good chance you'll run into MIPS often if that's your career. ARM might be a bit bigger these days in embedded devices, but you probably wouldn't be doing ASM even if you worked with ARM devices unless you're doing serious system engineering. These days you can have GBs of RAM in your ARM embedded device.

Not to mention, there's tons of good MIPS simulators that are wonderful. I couldn't think of a better choice for college students.","1446336505"

"AskCulinary","t5_2t82m","I've made apple butter before, maybe I can help. Pretty much it's as easy as /u/Seeker005 said: Peel,core and slice/chunk your apples, throw them in a slow cooker, season with a good amount of sugar/brown sugar/maple syrup even (if you were doing a full crock pot I'd say like...a cup overall? Depends on the sweetness of the apples) and add your seasonings (again depending on what you want, different amount but do just a few teaspoons of each) and then you can add something like a port wine or bourbon but commonly people use apple cider or juice to help the stewing process along and give it a slightly different flavor profile. I like using cider vinegar to get a bit of a bite to it (again, it will depend on your apples). I recommend at least a couple cups of juice or cider to help them stew, then season with your other liquid. Don't worry, we can cook off any of that excess liquid. After letting it all cook overnight or whatever you can mix it up good and taste it, adjust your seasonings if you want more/less of something. Then blend it all in a  blender, or a food mill, whatever you have to make it real smooth. You know it's done when it's tasty and you can mound it on a spoon, almost like a thick pudding.

 Also I hope this helps you out OP. Bourbon sounds tasty! 

I've done mine in a similar manner, on a stove top until the apples get soft. Then I blend them and continue cooking them in the over, uncovered, for a few hours, mixing periodically.","1446336507"

Everybody learns languages differently, but each textbook only provides one perspective. It's important to experiment to find the best explanations for you.

Also, do your own vocabulary research and create your own Memrise vocabulary decks.

"baldursgate","t5_2t07j","Have you considered Haer'Dalis? I know some people hate his voice acting and or dialogue, but a blade is a lot of fun throughout the game, from early levels with their spins all the way till TOB endgame.


The improved bard song is a unique damage buff and it stacks when you have multiple images/projections singing. The buff is especially potent for backstabbing, so bring Jan along and have 3 mislead Jan projections with staff of the ram buffed with 3 improved bard songs go to town. :) But it's also good for just plain fighter damage. Among other things it adds +4 to damage, so if you have only two images singing that's a +8 buff, which makes two whirlwinding fighters do an extra 160 damage, which is on par with bringing an extra fighter instead of the blade. And that's disregarding all his other benefits.


Another thing about bards in general is that they level faster than mages, which makes the spells effected by level more potent faster.


Also Haer'Dalis has some interesting dialogue with Aerie if you're romancing her.","1446336512"

"transcendental","t5_2uk27","&gt; Deepak Chopra was a follower of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and practices TM. His explanation in this video may help you.

Deepak gets confused easily; more-so since he stopped talking to Maharishi over 20 years ago and never trained as a TM teacher. His insights are no better than the 5 million other people who learned TM in the past 55 years, and from this video, are possibly worse  than average -certainly he proves that he's no world-teacher.

Disclosure: I own several of Deepak's books in 1st edition, autographed.

I also did publicity work for him back in the day, and am on a first-name basis with his first publicist and his second.

Edit: and why would you tell the guy to go to some random person on youtube rather than going back to his own teacher? What kind of fundamental idiocy is that? The OP paid for a lifetime free followup program (assuming he is in the USA).

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","The reason he was on the football team is because he was arguably the 49ers' best preseason player bar none. He made great plays as a punt returner and a runner. He outplayed Mike Davis in the preseason and showed more promise as a runner. Just as a caveat, when he was our punt returner teams punted away from him because they were afraid of him. Yes, he is raw and made mistakes, some of which came from a lack of experience in the sport, but cutting him before he was given a proper shot is a huge slap in the face and a stain on the organization and the coaches. What kind of player will want to play for an organization with inept coaching and a management team that will throw you to the curb at moments notice (if you need more evidence of management throwing players to the curb look at what is happening to Kaepernick rn) It's especially a stain on the organization when you cut a fan favorite and promote Kendall fucking Gaskins. Kendall Gaskins is the worst running back in the league bar none as of right now, and I hope to god as a 49ers fan he doesn't see the field as an offensive player. Gaskins at best might be a ST body, but you don't cut your second RB and a ST player for a guy with a ceiling of being a serviceable special teams player. Ultimately, Hayne is a better player and prospect than Gaskins and didn't deserve to be cut for him. I can't speak to whether Hayne is a serviceable player in the league, but he was the best we had with Carlos Hyde and Reggie Bush injured and we cut him, and as a 49ers fan I think I have the right to be upset at management (not Jed York in this case but Trent Baalke, the 49ers' GM) over this move.

1. Takes a clock out of its casing and puts in a pencil case, obviously resembles a small classic movie-bomb with wires. It didn't have to resemble an *actual* bomb, just what your typical American could mistake a bomb for. School didn't require it, didn't seem to be educational. 

2. Brings it to class and shows it to every teacher, after being told by engineering teacher to put it away and not show it to anyone else. Plugs in clock for no reason during class so alarm set to go off during class goes off. 


3. Teacher calls police over what seems to be a hoax bomb, Ahmed is uncooperative and allegedly repeats ""it's a clock"" without bothering to explain the situation further. Ahmed's sister (who also had some attention for a separate incident) is ready to snap picture and post on social media, sympathetic NASA shirt and all.

4. Father is part of an anti-islamophobia think tank who's job is basically influencing public thought when it comes to Muslims. He obviously can guess how liberals react when they hear this story for the first time, and buys pizza for reporters, doing everything he can to encourage the shitshow and make it a national story. Ahmed is fed lines by his sister while she's present at subsequent interviews, where he is much more forthcoming about the clock than he was with police.

...And I just got worked up about this again.

"mtgcube","t5_2smkx","Sorry it took so long to reply, i've been busy, and well it took a while to go though everything with cuts and such. thanks, that's all great info. pretty much all your cuts i was considering already (its been about 1+ year from our last add/cut).  

with white i agree, all except for mist meadow, he has been a beast in our cube (and has absurd synergy with quicksilver clone dude, but were going to cut him). 

Blue im with you 100%. omnisicence was in for testing, as we have a bunch of cheat options, and with show and tell and eureka we thought it might be good. it hasn't been. 

with red were adding the wildefire suite for sure, and were going to finish adding splinter twin, and a few more creatures (exarch, and village bell ringer). fury charm is in there because artifacts are really good, and its like a shatter+. will take it out. i disagree with Kargan Dragonlord, in RDW you need some mid game mana sinks, so this and x burn usually are what you need to finish out the game. red sun's zenith has been really good, cast it early to fill your curve, draw it later to win. blazing shoal is really good, has won quite a few games. usually in either RDW, or sneak attack decks. 

for green we have cut pelakka wurm, because we just had better stuff at 7+ drop range. elvish piper was cut because we just have better cheat things into play (defense of the heart, eureka, and ramp).  we cut birthing pod because unless you got it early in the first pack it was basically unplayable, and even if you did the pay off was way worse than any of the other ""build around me"" cards (recurring nightmare, tinker, show and tell, sneak attack, eureka etc). as for cuts i think i'll cut all of those save for veteran explorer. he has been amazing. sure you both get two extra lands, but one is two extra lands in a ramp deck, the other is just in a normal curve deck, so you have more to do with the extra mana.  

ensnaring bridge has been played in control decks, especially planes walker control decks, and has been crazy good. ageratum armor is being cut, along with your other colorless suggestions. i'll draft your cube a few times. 

if you have time i'd love to get feedback on multi colored :) lemme know if i can do anything for you.

Nope.  If it was some sort of brown out then other electrical devices on that circuit would also be having problems. Also most systems will attempt to come back on after a brown out unless you have specified in the BIOS to stay turned off.  

I would unplug and then plug in all cables one by one in the system to verify that all cables are plugged in properly. I would also examine the board for any damaged capacitors due to this bit:

"AMA","t5_2r4eo","I think you're being smart with me, but I do writing on the side so lucky for you, I know about multidimensional characters. They need to have a primary goal. Money, love, safety, etc. From there they need morals. What will/won't they do to achieve that goal? How do they react to others doing something they would never do? Do they speak up against it, or are they more meek and let others do what they will? Develop their fears, and reasons for having them. Make a list of their top 5 day-to-day priorities, in order of importance. At least one of those priorities should help move them towards their goal in some large or small way. 

Develop mannerisms. Do they command attention when in a room, or do they blend into the crowd? What are their nervous habits, why do they have them, are they aware of them or is he subconsciously biting his finger nails? Where are they from? How does this affect their speech? The delivery of the dialogue should line up with their mannerisms, not work against them. A man who folds into himself in public is not going to yell everything he says, that sort of thing. 

What is their economic status? What do they do for a living, and is it what they want to be doing? Who were their parents and siblings, did they get along, were they a favored child, the scapegoat, or just forgotten in the mix of things? How was their economic status as a kid, is it different now, how did that affect them? What about their past do they resent, regret, and cherish?

Dig deeper. What do they truly and honestly believe in as a ruling power? Love? A higher being? Fate? Maybe they're religious, or superstitious? How do these work into their morals, ideals, and actions? How does this affect how they treat others?

Deeper still. What would absolutely break them? Why? Are they strong enough to overcome that, if so, how? Do they fold in the face of that struggle? Find out their breaking point, imagine them being pushed to it. Really get to know them. 

This should all work within your dialogue, meaning if your lines are witty banter then your character is likely not a wallflower, or is talking to a very close friend. Some things should come organically from the lines your character says, grow them from there and add what you need. ","1446336516"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Mm.... it does have extra complications. The British putting an end to the Transatlantic Slave Trade in 1807 (famously boarding and freeing slave ships of other nations - especially Spanish) forced the antebellum South to adopt a much stronger racial policy in order to maintain the slave population. Before the end of the slave trade the average life expectancy of a slave in the Americas was 7 years (I am not sure if this includes the Caribbean slaves or not, this is a figure I was taught many years ago). In order to keep the slave population steady the South began aggressively expanding who was regarded a slave. The ""one drop"" policy was implemented in this manner to help create a social under-class of mixed-race people who fit the same profile as a slave while not being a slave.

This decision involved race but was an attempt by the powerful to exploit the powerless. Previously 1/4 white parentage was enough to be considered white in legal contexts in most southern districts. What mattered wasn't that these people were black or white, it was that the rich landowners were facing a labour shortage if they did not create this under-class as their slave labour source was dwindling and breeding a large enough number of healthy slaves was not economically advantageous.

Of course you can write whole dissertations and spend years studying this and not get to any kind of conclusive answer but I think it is wrong to both state ""Race had nothing to do with it"" AND to state that ""only the ignorant and the malicious would clam [race had nothing to do with it]""

You can view it as a problem of power dynamics that shifted into a racial problem, or you can view it as a racial problem throughout the 1700/1800s and both views have merit. ","1446336519"

"linux","t5_2qh1a","It *is* fully functional. Wayland will do everything you expect a display server to do, and has been capable of doing this for a few years now.

There's no driver for Nvidia GPUs that enables it to run on those cards, yet though. But if you have an Intel CPU / integrated graphics in your laptop - go nuts. Gnome works perfectly. XWayland benefits from all of Wayland's improvements, so anything that doesn't have native Wayland support will still run just as smoothly (there's probably an article somewhere that addresses the fact that you're thinking ""XWayland misses the point"").

So the issue is not with Wayland. It's with Nvidia and with the fact that Gnome isn't to everybody's tastes. I'm not aware of how complete KDE support is. Someone's doing a rewrite of i3 for Wayland somewhere, too.

So please do flood Nvidia with emails demanding a Wayland driver.

And as Penguin does some speech about how he bested Galavan, and that his men are on their way to the warehouse to save his mom right now, Galavan's final trick up his sleeve is that she's already dead.

It's sort of like Pyrrhic victory for Penguin because he's been doing all this stuff for Galavan while she was dead the whole time, he never had a chance save her at all, regardless of how good of a lacky he was

Trash man stopped, looked at his clip board, saw our trash service was disconnected, peered into the bag, looked around, threw the bag in the cab and emptied the can.

Relax, deep breaths, she hasnt just sent you a picture of her tits with the message 'come on over big boi'. She's being a nice human. That's all, would you do the same if a guy replied?

And he seemed to forgive his family members pretty easily no matter how much they fucked up (like Trebol and Diamante). He definitely doesn't see them as his equal, but he also doesn't treat them like disposable trash like Bellamy either. 

Personally, I think he does care about them, but in his own egotistical twisted way. In my opinion, his superiority complex is so off the charts that he genuinely believed letting his subordinates sacrifice themselves for him was giving them the 'honor' to do so. Especially if you look at how he handled the whole Op-Op no mi plan. He wasn't shady about it at all. He didn't hide the fact that he expected Rosi to die for him; almost like it was a given or even an incentive. Cause if you look at the people Doffy kept in that Corazon seat (expecting them to sacrifice themselves to give him immortality), it was people that he seemed to trust the most.

From: http://islamqa.info/en/20738

&gt; Mut’ah or temporary marriage refers to when a man marries a woman for a specific length of time in return for a particular amount of money. 

&gt; The basic principle concerning marriage is that it should be ongoing and permanent. Temporary marriage – i.e., mut’ah marriage – was permitted at the beginning of Islam, then it was abrogated and became haraam until the Day of Judgement. 

&gt; It was narrated from ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade mut’ah marriage and the meat of domestic donkeys at the time of Khaybar. According to another report, he forbade mut’ah marriage at the time of Khaybar and he forbade the meat of tame donkeys.

&gt; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3979; Muslim, 1407.

Seriously, people are way more complex than your opinion of them, so don't put them on a pedestal.

So she seems really extraverted, great! That's a wonderful quality to have.  Maybe she's really curious and asks lots of questions (intelligence), that's cool too.  Don't be jealous and try to compare yourself to her, instead just try to understand what you admire specifically.  Your mind is still developing, and it's okay to change yourself a little bit in the name of self-improvement.

John Boehner, as much as I dislike him, took the debt ceiling issue off the table until after the election right before he left -- the main issue causing division in the GOP.  From here on out, things are looking pretty good.

As soon as we are facing Hillary, we will be united further.  Nothing unites conservatives like a Clinton.  The only thing that could possibly unite us more is a self described socialist.

As to the possibility of this being a prank, I don't think it is. Given that only a select few people know that specific part of your past, and as you said, none of them seem likely to do such a thing. 

On the other hand, it would be extremely difficult to pull off such a prank, not appearing in video one, and then appearing in video three, when they are consecutive videos. 

How would someone pulling a prank know to appear at that exact moment, during that specific time of day? How many people asked about the birds this time, and did your friend that texted you ask about them, before hand? 

Would it be okay to assume that the people who know about your past already know about the birds and wouldn't have asked you about them (therefore not knowing that you would record those videos)?

He was on pain meds his entire (short) life. He had chronic cat flu due to not being treated as a kitten until he came to live with us. He was so scared of people, afraid of men and of hands. We really believe he had been abused.  
But he fought for everything and lived and played. And because we had to look after him all the time, he was extremely close to us. Milo loves attention, but also likes being alone. Noodle would follow you everywhere. He'd sleep in the bed (being your little spoon) where Milo would just come to check in every couple of hours. He was my best friend.

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","Well, time will tell.  You have to wait and see if they sue.

IF they do, you have a good defence, ""the truth"".  As long as your review is based on facts, and your opinions flow from those facts, you should be ok.

But, being that you are 18, and have no money (likely) it isn't going to be worth their effort.  Plus, even if they won, they have to prove their damages... How much damage could your review have caused?  Likely a judge would award a very small award if your words were truly offside.

What you need to know is the test is how realistic your opinion was based on the facts.  So, if you said ""I went in for service.  I was told I needed xxxx done.  It sounded suspicious, so I took my car to another mechanic who said that xxx was unnecessary.  I feel this dealership was trying to charge me for services that I don't need, and take advantage of me.  My advice is to stay away.""  ... Would likely all be fine.

If you said instead ""I went in for service and they recommended xxx, which I didn't need, and another mechanic told me was unnecessary.  Stay away from this place, they are all scammers, out to steal your money to feed their drug habits.  The whole place is full of drug addled racists who want to take advantage because I'm a minority and they are racists and drug addicts"".  Would be totally out of line as your ""opinion"" that they are druggies and racists is not in line with the facts.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","You should tell her more about the context/setting/arrangements, not necessarily about the number of partners. Some people have strong feelings about exchanging money for favors. It's been six years, it doesn't sound like someone recognized you on the street and you haven't had any awkward confrontations before; it's understandable to think this secret is safe. Thing is that those secrets tend to pop up at the moments you least want/expect them. 

You're now ready to take a big step with your gf. She should be aware of circumstances and how you changed your life. So she doesn't get a nasty surprise if someone remarks about this. It could definitely kill the relationship, but this is some big part of your past. In case of no acceptance, you don't want to deal with a divorce. The timing of you quitting that job might be something she has a bigger issue with, so you will have to explain what she does for you what others/that job doesn't.

Others might think it's something you should hide, if you feel it's better, do so. But this is just something i'd like to know before the I Do - phase, else marriage becomes a trap in a way, adding another layer of betrayal. ","1446336542"

I am not one of those alternatives, and while I wish you the best with creating the family you deserve, I ask that you do not bring this up again.""

Don't do this charade, OP. Do you really think it will be bearable to have something that's a part of you be taken away? To watch as they make the executive decisions regarding his education, parenting, development, etc, while you play nanny when they want a night off?

If your fear is that you will never have kids of your own, then you need to understand that he is playing off your fear. The solution to ""I work too much and don't meet people"" is to work less and meet more people. Not to say fuck it, I'll get my motherly needs handled by being a surrogate. 

You can find someone who will love you and want a family with you - you are 30. Make the sacrifices to put yourself out there and date, and find someone who genuinely wants a family with you. Bottom line is, you will never be a part of their family, of their ""circle"" if you will. No matter how they present it, you're signing up for a lifetime of crazy, unending drama for little reward. 

What happens when they decide to shut you out because ""it's getting confusing to little Timmy to have two mommies?""

Fuck this shit. Giving into this because it's the only way you feel like you're going to fake like you have a family is ultimately cowardly. I say that not to be mean, but because that's how I see it - you are choosing to give into the fear that you'll never meet someone and have a love-child, so you're defaulting to the infinitely shittier plan B because ""it's at least something.""

Look up the Gaiden chapter requirements, and save those divine weapons for the endgame.

Look up the different routes you can take. Bartre and Echidna are on two different routes. There is also a route split between easier Ilia and harder Sacae.

Be careful with early game, don't be afraid to use Marcus a lot to get by. Also, Roy's rapier is really useful.

Be very wary of status staves, use Fae to bait them.

In general, consider a more defensive strategy for earlier maps. The game gets much easier at chapter 9.

"Undertale","t5_2xdht","Since when has Sans lost his soul? They just have monster souls. They also feel emotions anyway, so I don't see what you mean.

Also, remember those two guys in front of Gillby's in Snowden? They essentially said that monsters are overwhelmed by their current crises but tell jokes to distract themselves from their sadness. Sans has more to feel bad about than most. He's given up on something important to him, and if you listen to his Lost Soul you can tell that his laziness isn't just his nature, it's a result of his giving up. He's become nihilistic and doesn't see the point in anything anymore. That's why I don't see Sans angst as out of character. Papyrus is the only person he cares about anymore, and perhaps Toriel. If you kill everyone but Pap, he even works extra hard to keep the kingdom running, despite his assertions in other endings that he's not the leader type. So no, Sans is not a happy jokester. He's in immense pain and uses humor to keep himself sane and to keep others from worrying about him.","1446336549"

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","I played Fallout 3 on 360 first then got it much much later on PC. My pc isn't very good so all those things you mentioned up there are probably not even possible on my system. FO3 did look better on my pc though, even with my shitty setup. The way it looked however was only momentary to me. I was so swept away by the game play and quests that the ugly 360 graphics didn't really matter. Are you able to enjoy a game whilst looking for all these flaws? 
Fallout for me is a bit of a double edged sword, i love the game, the setting the atmosphere but i am not a big fan of Bethesda. My fond memories of FO3 are tainted by the memories or all the freezes and crashes. To this day i don't think FO3 works right on consoles, it works pretty good on my pc but that is only due to help from the modding community. 
I'm not to worried about how it looks. I'll be playing on Xbone so am not expecting much in terms of graphics. I am more concerned at the lack of live game play we have seen. I'm not even sure if there has been any now i come to think of it. Could it be another technical mess do you think? and that is why there has been so little in game coverage? ","1446336549"

Then give me MGS1, 2 and 4 themed outfits/faces (Let me see soldiers saluting my Big Boss wearing a Solidus suit), I loved the dumb camo faces in MGS4 of other characters.

Especially Liquid, holy shit Fox Engine Adult Liquid with his  Foxhound Coat and the very obvious naked option of being completely shirtless except for dogtags would be badass. (If the coat wasn't very practical to animate I would settle for Liquid having a naked option only, as long as he had his head as an option.

Every character in the series except him has gotten a new appearance update at some point in Metal Gear media, Big Boss got it with MGS3D and Peace Walker, Solid Snake got it with the legacy collection art, never Liquid.

Additionally, Loki offers one of the best cc spells in the game. If he mods for Irradiating Disarm, not only are all the enemies in the room now melee, they also attack each other so your group doesn't even have to do damage. 

As /u/LalupTv noted, Ash is much better for damage (Loki pretty much has no damage). However, since frames have to mod for both damage and survivability (let alone range and all that), their damage does not scale late as well as weapon damage. So, while the damage from Ash will be great in many situations, it probably won't help much when you're really testing your might.","1446336554"

Eating carbs spikes your blood sugar, then it crashes, and suddenly you are hungry again.

Eating fats and proteins , your blood sugar level stays relatively moderated, meaning you don't trigger a hormonal imbalance that messes with appetite.

The relationship between glycemic index and insulin feedback, between fats in the stomach and a sensation of satiety, between your endocrine system and you brain - all these things have a dramatic impact on the effectiveness of a diet.

With a carb-rich diet, it requires incredible willpower to not be stuffing yourself when the crash hits. With a fat-rich diet, you don't crash, and simply don't feel the urge to eat as much.

At the end of the day, your weight loss or gain may be mostly about calories in and out. But how you get your calories, and the effect on your blood sugar, can make it much easier - or harder - to stick to your diet.","1446336556"

Assuming they're using reasonable debugging and error output tools, the *causes* of most of the crashes and some of the other significant issues shouldn't be incredibly difficult to track down. Resolving them could be hard.

Performance is a whole other beast, though. It could be any number of things causing problems, and resolving a performance issue may involve recoding entire sections of their previous solutions. That's the part I'm worried about.

We don't care if none of our friends wanna fuck a chick.

Secondly, your stated purpose of the app really doesn't help men like myself, who after 34 years on the planet and losing my virginity at 15, who have become very, very adept at spotting slut tells.  Ipso facto, I wouldn't pay for it or subscribe to it. 

Remember the **core tenet** of TRP:  We aren't here to fight the system.  Let the MRA's like Paul Elam kill themselves with hypertension trying to do that.  We are here to enjoy all of the ""empowering"" free sex these feminist whores are trying to dole out to the men who tingle their vaginas.

I feel like - while there obviously was a lot of mystery in the first season - the second season has me asking a lot more questions, wanting to know more right now; fuck waiting till next week for answers. I don't remember having that feeling from the first season so much. 

I like that this season isn't all about the first 'disappearance'... there's a whole other disappearance (lol) and arson and schizophrenia and miracle hugs and all kinds of new shit.

Seriously though. It's a great show. The only show that has even come close to slightly resembling Lost, IMO. So much mystery... can't wait to see where this season goes.

&gt; Som jeg skriver i bogen, har slaveri også eksisteret i andre kulturer, bl.a. den kristne. Forskellen er, at kristne ikke kan finde nogen retfærdiggørelse af en sådan adfærd i Det Nye Testamente.«

Både fordi det ignorerer hele det gamle testamente og fordi det alligevel ikke engang er sandt: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_slavery Det var da heller intet problem for kristne folk, der ville holder slaver, at finde på en eller anden teologisk begrundelse (ligeledes for alverdens andre grusomhed der er begået i guds navn).

I am still undecided if this is actually a true story or not, but it would explain Nisio's [obsession with](/s ""abused girls, and how they try to get out of their predicaments"").

"Games","t5_2qhwp","The people complaining about how this game looks worse than the Witcher 3 are forgetting a few important facts. 

Bethesda games favour large seamless open worlds, whereas TW3 is several smaller open maps with a loading transition, thus affording CDPR more breathing room when it comes to performance.

Second, most of these screens are from first person, so any graphical issues are far more noticeable. TW3 is third person and you spend a lot of your travel time on speeding along on horseback, so your perspective will be further away from the details and you will be less likely to see a dodgy ground texture or ornament anyway.

Lastly, Bethesda games have never exactly been pioneers of graphics tech anyway, when you want massive open worlds like theirs, it's an unfortunate sacrifice that must be made, especially for the console version shown here.","1446336574"

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","The thread PimpedUpMonk recommended is a good read.

I don't have a lot of experience, but if it helps, here are a few of the reasons I go to the store I do and not one of the other ones around:

It has a friendly atmosphere. The guys behind the counter are knowledgeable, helpful, and always eager / upbeat. They don't put up with asshattery and have managed to create an environment where everyone's there to relax and play some games. Everyone in the store felt like a friend from the moment I met them. And I think this is one of the biggest things to me. You want people to feel at home and you want new players/customers to leave the store thinking ""that was fun, these guys are alright"".

Online presence can't be stressed enough. Get a website and get a Facebook. Post updates, keep everything recent, etc. It really helps that I can just go online and see what the hours are, when events are being held, etc. They'll even post some pictures when there's a big turn out, which helps the hype roll over into the next week. ""Apparently the last Modern tournament was huge. I'll make sure not to miss it this week"". Plus, online presence is the reason I found the store in the first place.

It has a dedicated casual night. The tournaments and drafts are awesome, don't get me wrong. But I like that there's a night where everyone shows up and just plays whatever format they feel like, often with goofy homebrew decks. It's really good for new players and draws a nice cross section of players who ""main"" different formats.

They're located next to a donut shop. Most nights they have a box of donuts off to the side for us to help ourselves to. Everybody loves donuts.

There's a lot of things you can do, but first and foremost it's the atmosphere you create. Make people want to hang out there.","1446336574"

However, because WoTA is shackled to Revolver - which necessarily needs to be balanced around Vladimir (and WoTA to Vladimir respectively) - that item path is inaccessible to a large pool of champions *and* changing the item such that the power profile of WoTA could be more accessible to a wider variety of champions is also problematic - as you'd simply end up buffing Vladimir into kind of insanity.

Essentially, because Stinger influences the stat profile of Nashor's so much (because it needs a minimum amount of AS or CDR) - the actual Nashor's portion of it (Sustained damage that scales with AP) is restricted by the fact that you have to make fantastic use out of Attack Speed because the item has so much of it.  

This wouldn't be a tremendous problem if Nashor's Tooth actually fit on a large pool of champions - it would actually be a point in its favor if the champion pool that used Nashor's well was moderately sized - but since Nashors serves a very narrow subset of characters, it falls into a similar camp such as WoTA at this point.

Additionally, half the champions that *do* make use of Nashor's (Kayle, for instance) only use it because they scale with every conceivable item in the game - and therefore they simply choose which one is most powerful vs. gold at the time - and therefore don't particularly - so the pool is even smaller than it looks like at first glance, as these characters can and should abandon Nashor's at first jump if any other AP item is better. (And they have in the past, with Kayle bouncing between LB vs. Tooth vs. Whatever AP item was in vogue.)","1446336577"

I used to be in MathCA, I think officially the suggested average is low 90s, but most people I know in the program had around mid-90s or higher.

If you like math, I recommend MathCA for its flexibility to transfer into other math programs later on (what I did- and you can transfer into almost any other math program). You get all the benefits of AFM (in terms of career opportunities and core courses) plus some free optionality. 

If you go into AFM and want to transfer out later on, you'll have to catch up on courses which will put you behind in school. That being said, if you can't see yourself doing math for the next 4-5 years, AFM is likely a better bet.","1446336577"

I've worked in a company where we had offices with sliding glass doors. (One entire wall was transparent.) The offices looked out on a central atrium where meetings were held. You could hear and see everything that happened in the meeting from your office. By stepping out, you could see in one scan who was in their office or not. If there was a general conversation in the atrium, you could hear and see it, and step out and join it. 

If you needed quiet time, you closed your glass door.

30 year ago, we needed collaboration as much as today, if not more. We did not have the internet. If you needed new information, you talked to a colleague who could connect you to the right book, or introduce you to an expert who could help.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","You sound like a great coworker. Look, you're going to hurt his feelings. But you can do it gently, discreetly, and respectfully.

Ask him out to lunch, or ask to talk to him *near the end of his day.* If you manage to reach through to him, he's probably going to be upset and distracted, and self-conscious.

When you're out of earshot of anyone else, go with something like this:

""Bill, look I really need to bring something to your attention. This is a difficult subject, and it's going to be awkward. I'm also afraid that you might take it as offensive or insulting. I do not want to offend or insult you. If this were just something I thought myself, I'd probably say nothing. But even though I haven't talked about it with anyone else here, I have heard some other coworkers gossiping about it. I don't know if it's a medical issue, or something to do with your current living situation, or your daily hygiene. The problem is that you have a very strong, unclean odor coming from your body. It is noticeable, and seems to be a daily thing for you. I'm afraid that it is going to negatively affect your work and your reputation. I'm not asking for details, but if there's anything I can do to help you tackle this, I will be happy to do so.""

IOW: lead with your intentions -- you want to help, not hurt. Follow up with the difficulty of the subject and your concerns that he'll be insulted. Point out that it is something that others are both perceiving and talking about. Point out the problem, allowing for the possibility of a medical condition (Trimethylaminuria, aka ""Fish Odor Syndrome"", is an example; depression and serious self-neglect could be another.) Finally, offer some assistance. 

Normally I'd say lead with your main point, but this is one where it could so easily be misinterpreted that he won't hear anything other than ""you smell like shit.""","1446336585"

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","As a means of studying, find a friend to whom you can recite information. This works very well for things like English or History, but I can imagine that sometimes it can work with Sciences.  
But it doesn't have to be about the studying. When I as taking a Religion class about the Gospels, I would always tell my brother funny renditions of my favorite stories we learned in class. I did the same for History, too. I distinctly remember one time when I was studying, I was in a Skype call with my friends (since I work better when I'm multitasking with a casual social situation) and I was giving them a gameshow-esque quiz on what I was studying to see if any of them happened to know. Some of the answers live on as inside jokes to this day. A friend of mine picked up on this strategy and has been sending me emoji filled ""Drunk History""-style texts.  
  
Even if you don't have someone on hand to necessarily recite it to, write down what you would say if you did!  
Personally, it also helps me if I comment on what I'm reading as I go along, either making idle commentary to my friends or keeping a log of my thoughts as I read or watch something.  
  
Taking extremely organized notes when I was reading things also helped me in high school. I would do it on the computer, and I would order information and mark it up accordingly. Not only did it make for good, quick review sheets, but the amount of time I spent working with and considering the information helped me to understand and retain it.  
Another good reading strategy is to write a very short summary, no more than one sentence, of what a paragraph says or is about. It helps you think about what's important as well as find information quicker when you're studying it.  
  
Finally, I highly suggest reading [this article](http://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/features/25-things-skilled-learners-do-differently/). One of my professors gave it to us in class and went over it with us. It's extraordinarily helpful.

"chicago","t5_2qh2t","While the pension being underfunded is terrible, his attack on the lifestyles and unfair size of pensions is ridiculous.

1.  Civil workers took a contract for 25, 30years+ to work at typically much lower salaries compared to private industry because they were guaranteed these benefits

2.  At least for my mom (a teacher), her pension was at least 75% funded out of her own pocket each paycheck

3.  Teachers don't receive social security because of the pension (10-20k/year)

4.  Pensions don't get passed down generations.  A large 401k vs a pension is better because someone could live off the interest and pass their wealth down.  Pensions simply disappear.  (this could be argued in a few ways though)

Overall though, I don't think it's fair to tell someone after 30 years of a legally binding contract, and something they've planned their entire lives around, that we are just going to reduce their retirement amounts.    Most pensions only hit $50k a year or so, which equates much closer to $1m than $2m if you look at a 3.5-4% portfolio withdrawal rate.  That's not exactly living it large, especially near a major urban city like Chicago.  A good pension was one of the only real perks/reasons for people to stay in these positions for so long.  It would be downright evil to take it away from them.","1446336587"

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","I realized that one drink was too many and 20 drinks was never enough. I always wanted more, no matter my intentions at first. ""oh just 3 beers"" - nope, finish the six pack and then drive to get more, keep drinking until passed out. In short, for me moderation was agony (and pointless).

I try not to think about forever. I think about today. That's been a big difference for me this last 145 days. Each day was its own day, if that makes sense. Every day I made the choice to not drink.

I used to get drunk and _____ fill in the blank. Most of the time alone. Get drunk and play video games. Get drunk and watch movies. So for me, doing what I used to do has been relatively easy, aside from the occasional thought of ""wouldn't it be great to have a beer right now while you kill zombies?""","1446336589"

Some advice?

Try to pull all the files in a directory with node, recursively, meaning you get a directory get all the files from that too. Harder than it seems. If you can get it in five lines or less you've probably done it well and elegantly.

Try your hand at detecting clicks on a button in the Dom. Without adding an event handler to that button, try it for two buttons with only one event handler. You'll learn that events bubble and make better code.

Try your hand at using nth-child, etc, in CSS to select all of the elements that are not of some type but at least the fifth element of that type. You'll learn selectors well.

Dabble with regex to detect an email or web address (and extract it) from any text. It will save you so much time knowing pattern matching techniques.

But most of all do it while building something you're excited about and try and make everything a challenge or fun!","1446336592"

Description: After some salty experiences in a laboratory, Salt came to life. He has no brain and only act with salt. When he senses a threat or is hungry he will salt down his targets. He is used by the salt guys to go onto the battlefield.

500 Health 100 Armor, he is a tank with a lot of salt and salt potential when he decides to leave his salt behind.

Skill-set:

(left click) Salt- Salt uses his elasticity to hit a target in melee range (like Reinhardt)

(right click) Salt-Salt leaves a part of salt behind that is destroyable and has 100 hp. (reduces he's own health by 50 when used.). Low cooldown.

(Shift) Salt Charge- Salt bounces of his current position and deals 150 salt to anything he passes through.

(e) Salt- All the left behind parts come back to Salt giving he's HP back and dealing salt to everything they passes through on the way.

(a, ultimate) Salt- Salt a target in close up range. The target is salt for 5 seconds, is incapacitated and takes salt over time if he is an enemy.","1446336592"

In a chain of comments, when someone is already unpopular and you show up with anything that isn't part of the circlejerk, [you'll get downvoted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Whatcouldgowrong/comments/3quv0l/im_going_to_cheat_to_win_this_race_wcgw/cwiwktu?context=3) I call it the negative karma train.

To score big karma, all you have to do is go into a popular subreddit and be [one of the first people to post something semi-entertaining.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thatHappened/comments/3dyaj0/when_youre_a_model_you_cant_even_relax_by_the/ct9tl4i?context=3) As everyone congratulates themselves for liking the same thing by upvoting you, you will get a bunch of karma.

Sometimes, a person can get downvoted for [being an argumentative dick.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/2nkxo7/woman_kicks_dinner_out_of_homeless_mans_hands_he/cmennh5?context=5). But, [sometimes you'll get rewarded for it, even if you feel bad for doing it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/3qv0q0/british_man_serenely_defends_homestead/cwixjhp?context=6)

While it doesn't always work, [writing something insightful or thoughtful](https://www.reddit.com/r/watchpeopledie/comments/3h3mke/rwatchpeopledie_saved_my_life_today/cu40oew) can earn karma.

At the end of the day, karma is NOT a reflection of your contribution, so don't take it to heart.","1446336592"

"truetf2","t5_2stfn","""I think the main reason the direct hit doesn't get used as much is because its less effective to bomb with than anything else.""

""you can rocket jump to move fast to get a positional advantage to DM something, escape, take on the scout with help from someone else, etc.""

You need to hit two &gt;60 damage rockets to kill an unbuffed scout, nevermind anything else.

You're wrong, pls. Direct hit is viable in HL (which is what we're talking about), and it has some things about it that are broken and I think the game would benefit from it being rebalanced, I don't see a problem with the rebalance I suggested.

You seem to be trying to be trying to give examples of situations where running the direct hit will fuck you up and running the rocket launcher will change the situation significantly, the fact of the matter is: a good player would use gamesense and positioning to ensure he isn't in these situations.","1446336596"

A lot of people tend to forget this, but they also work on Wolfenstein, Doom, Dishonored, all of which have drastically different engines and looks. Why?

"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt;Love  the character designs in this, they looks so...classic. Especially the female characters.  
  
I know right?? it has such a sleek, 80's style aesthetic. this movie really makes me wish for a re-emergence of that look. it's really cool to see detailed character designs like that with the level of animation of modern or semi-modern technology.  
  
the main guys in the film are all bishonen bliss. D is husbando. I don't care if nasty hand ghoul hates his fashion sense, he both looks and acts just so cool unf. Grove's power might be my favorite thing from a design standpoint. he sortof reminds me of a bullet hell shooter for some reason. and Meier is just such a likable person, when all is said and done. the rocket ship part at the end made me tear up. :(  
  
I'm glad you liked it!! I remember loving it when I was younger and hoping really hard that it held up over the years and wasn't just a consequence of being an edgy preteen, but it's really solid throughout. it's difficult to manage all the themes and genres it was playing at in an eloquent way, and was able to be a good action film, a good sci-fi film, a good character drama, and a good romance film all at the same time. it really holds up, and I'm really excited for [the reboots coming in the next few years](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-30/exclusive-vampire-hunter-d-has-new-animated-series-in-the-works/.89840)!","1446336597"

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","How do you hate Esamir walls but think Hossin platforms are fine? It's the same problem with limited points of access, except now Heavy Assaults can stand still and farm from above instead of just hit-and-run Light Assaults. 

Hossin is a ""fuck you"" continent, made for farmers who don't like to move around. Platform bases have limited access points which can easily be camped. Try to get in the wrong way and you have to run 80% around before finding an entrance. Or maybe 160% around because the other side of the base was impassible. ""Fuck you, new players.""

Terrain has lots of dead ends and pointless cliffs, forcing vehicles to move along narrow choke points. If you try to go offroad you'll get stranded, flipped, or find yourself in what looked like a path but is actually blocked at the end. ""Fuck you, drivers.""

The tree canopy, while initially assumed to be protection from air, is only an impediment to new pilots. Experienced ones benefit from the easy LOS break and can farm and run with impunity. ""Fuck you, infantry and new pilots"". (With a special bonus thanks to the bases that spawn a vehicle 10m from a branch.)

The fog benefits people who sit still watch for movement, at the expense of those who are moving and trying to differentiate players from background. It especially hurts people whose vision isn't as strong, who never recovered from the ""fuck you"" of darker nights that the MLG crowd requested for us. It also benefits the air farmers who frequently use thermals.  No issue for them, just their victims. ""Fuck you anyone who thinks games are more fun if you move around.""

The base designs - while creative in parts - get too clever when they move the vehicle pad far from the terminal. This leaves you completely vulnerable to tank mines unless you take a minute to jump down, check, redeploy back, and run back to the terminal. And hope no one placed mines during that trip. (Which happens.) ""Fuck you, people with limited nanites.""

I think if you're the right combination of MLG farmer you might love Hossin. I still play on it because I like the variety of bases and I think the small fights are a bonus not a drawback. But it's so heavily built for farming and raising the skill floor that it's clear no one behind it had any concept of player acquisition.","1446336597"

I assume it isn't steaming hot by the time it is home, so no - letting it stay out does nothing but increase the chances of accumulating food born pathogens. There is a concern of hot food heating the environment of your refrigerator, but if the food is already within the TDZ that risk is not likely as 140 degrees is relatively cool. 

Wait to put food in the freezer / refrigerator only if it is above 140 degrees - i.e. *hot* not ""a little warm."" If you place a pan of steaming water or a casserole fresh out of the oven into your fridge, it will have a profound impact on the temperature of everything inside and there is also no need to cool it quickly - it can sit out without risk until it passes below 140 degrees, as temperatures higher than that would kill air born pathogens, assuming no cross contamination.

Please also consider the origin of the maker of the cars in your study, and the market where they are sold.  Example: global car companies i.e. VW/Honda/Ford build tons of cars in plants all over the world from source parts often nearer to the manufacturing centers in which they are built, or, are shipped entirely to a different region.  The quality varies in a scale that needs to almost separate an individual feature in a car, measuring its overall reliability or quality is going to be interpretation and fodder for magazine writers and sales brochure people to play with.  

If you truly want to use the word ""quality"" it almost has to be a quantifiable variable--what does quality even ""mean"" for this study: longevity/durability/ease of use? 

""Quality"" is an interpretive term unless you really define it for the particular study.  I do warn you that getting accurate data will be extremely difficult, as carmakers don't exactly publish this information with a cherry on top.  Thus, A good start for some ideas is the NHTSA website, for North America at least.  There you could study recalls, overall problem with specific parts, etc.  

So, please consider breaking down the variables and measurement data--otherwise you will be up to your nostrils in source data that is unquantifiable or junk.

I had no specific use case for the `Foldable` instance in mind but others have mentioned a few in the discussions over the last few weeks, including other threads of this post I believe.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; As I can google the treaty of Versallies yet we spend Every year of K-8 an equal amount of time on History as Math, Science and Language.

That's the thing about history: if I learn about the history of Versailles for a day and am really intrigued, I can go online and read all about it. The same goes for Israel: if it gets brought up in a history class and I feel like finding it on a map, I can do that. What if I don't know what the treaty of Versailles is because I've never studied world war I and don't know anything about the history of Versailles under the reign of Louis XIV and later its relevance in terms of the French revolution? History class gives people a broad understanding of a huge time frame, and different people can hone in their interest after they do some broad learning. 

&gt;It's a lot more logical to discuss a specific region in a Geography class or discuss the findings of Galelio in an Astronomy or Physics class. Grouping all these events by time isn't going to be very effective in teaching the lessons themselves.

I disagree here. Sure, it is one thing to understand Galileo's scientific principles and know that the sun is the center of the universe, but does it mean much to study Galileo if you don't know what was happening around him? Like everyone, he was a product of his environment, and it is important when studying Galileo to know that he was alive during the height of the scientific revolution, and was actually tried as a witch due to his claims, put on house arrest, and it was actually there he did most of his writing. 

&gt;Grouping all these events by time isn't going to be very effective in teaching the lessons themselves.

I would disagree. As I said, it is important to know the events surrounding a person to truly understand their message. As I mentioned earlier, Machiavelli worked for the ruling family in Florence right before they were dethroned by a friar, and he was partially blamed, ending his career as an advisor, so he went to work writing, and it is easy to understand how his 'dog eat dog' and 'end justifies the means' philosophies came to be in such a volatile political place. 

&gt;I've never had a European history class nor have I heard of one outside of higher education. Assuming you're a History major or something relevant or at least interested enough to study it in higher education I think that's incredible if you can really understand the issues of Sociology, Geography, Economics through a History vessel.

I took the class in 10th grade (I'm in HS now), and it's an AP course, so that means it is taken somewhat widely by high school students.

&gt;I think it's fantastic that you can relate all those things but not all of us are like that and asking the minds of K-8 to think like that is quite a large task.

So would you rather have a bunch of 10 year old kids sitting around memorizing maps all day? History allows kids at a young age to think critically and draw comparisons to their daily lives; I remember that, after learning about WWI at a young age, I was so excited to be able to come home to my family and get involved in a discussion that was at all relevant to what I'd learned in school. Furthermore, history is far more interesting to learn than something like naming where Namibia is on a map, and, if a 5th grader really won't learn anything that important in 5th grade, at least let them have fun and find out what they're interested in.

&gt;If we are strictly speaking higher education what is the application of your history knowledge in the work force?

This is one of those things that honestly can be applied to anything. Even if I am a STEM major, very few fields will require things I directly learn in college. To go to med school, a student needs credits in advanced levels of biology and chemistry, and I don't think many doctors are using much knowledge about organic chemistry in their daily lives. How many jobs do you think use advanced calculus on a daily basis? 

I'm not advocating for everyone to be a history major in college, as I agree it isn't very helpful in the job market, but I think kids should take history all through high school, and maybe take a history course for a year or two in college.","1446336606"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","We were a lv 4 party consisting of a Drow Ranger (me), a Half-Elf Bard, a Human Monk, a Forest Elf Druid and a Forest Elf Cleric/Rogue. After investigating some kidnappings on the city we discover a secret organization that wants to make undead labour a legal thing and we discover that the city will be overrun by a great army of goblinoids lead by Drows (the city is in the same region of Cormanthor).
We hear about a dungeon holding some special items that could help us in the fight against the army, but it had some sort of mortal puzzle as no one has ever came back from it. That dungeon had 5 doors that needed to be open at the same time, so the party was divided, each door represented an element (the fifth door was death). On the first room was a thematic room from the corresponding element, the objective was to find the key and open the door to the next room, after some exploration and bad use of resources by the bard everyone cleared that room and on the way found what the DM described as a randomly generated magic item. But then I became mad at the DM, he put a elemental to go against solo each player (the death one was a flame skull), they were  ""nerfed"" (only had half hp and no multiattack). Only the monk that went against the fire one, and the cleric that went against the air one won the fight, the bard without her level 2 slots died really fast against the earth elemental, the same for the druid and the water elemental (the fight took place in a room filled with water) and bad luck gave a suboptimal magic weapon (longsword) to my dex ranger that only had piercing weapons against the flaming skull. In the end  because some of us had failed the challenge the spirits came back and finished the job. My problem with this approach was not only the obvious lack of information from the DM part (yeah we really asked like half of the city about the dungeon) and some bad decision on putting us on  a solo battle against elementals. In the end I think he just got bored on the campaign and wanted to put in action and adventure in hell, but it was really frustrating dying to such an absurd challenge like a solo fight to death, one that if you didn't had a optmized build you would never be able to win.","1446336606"

"mentalhealth","t5_2qirg","You would be much better well served, in my opinion, to simply find yourself a good, competent counselor or therapist.

Going into a mental hospital or ward is for crazy people. I mean nuts. You can't even begin to imagine. 

No hospital, medical or mental, affords a patient any rest or respite from the stress of daily life. They create More stress in your life.

 They Never leave you alone and frankly, unless you have the world's most accomodating health insurance they won't keep you there.

I am not a doctor but it sounds a lot like you are building up a lot of your mental issues in your own mind.
 Sometimes people who are struggling with minor mental health issues get so far into their own head they build a monster wall of self perceived illnesses.

Talking to a professional, laying out on the line what is truly a health issue with you and what is simply worry and anxiety is a major start.

 Therapists are very helpful in teaching you skills and tools to deal with every day life, and quite importantly, learn how to get out into the real world and interact.

 The job you are discussing sounds like a boon, a benefit in your life , between that and good, regular mental health care (outpatient) there is no reason you cannot get your self and your attitudes back on the right track.

"science","t5_mouw","Here's the short version. 

Currently, these fusion reactors require power input to keep the reaction going. If you thing of fire as a metaphor, it's like taking a blowtorch to a large log. Keep the torch on and the log will burn (the fusion reaction continues), but turn the torch off and the fire goes out, because it was not big enough to get the whole log burning on its own. An external source of power (the torch) is needed. Once you learn how to make a fire properly, you only have to put in a little energy from the torch, and then the fire grows and gives off a lot more heat than the torch put in. 

As for why this would provide more power than other sources, that is a deeper physics thing. Basically, just like nuclear fission reactions give more energy per unit fuel consumed than chemical reactions, nuclear fusion provides more power again. Plus, as I understand it, fusion leaves behind fewer nasty byproducts.","1446336611"

You're intentionally never told to go there for the cutscenes, which I think is to tie into my way of looking at, but I'm sure they thought most players would wander around any and all new platforms - or the main ones of each unit at the very least, since they made those unique from one another - and either be drawn towards the door by its light or stumble upon it by accident.

People also prefer to get blu rays as they are more durable. No from a collecting standpoint i dont think it will be that collectible. ANd the reasoning behind everyone posting wii games is because Gamestop is clearing their stock. Its funny how one minute everyone will be saying that gamestop is so evil but when the deals start rolling everyone suddently everyone goes there.

That needs to be done under the supervision of a professional counsellor so dont try that yourself. Often people who want to understand themselves better and how to fix their own problems go into the field of Psychology or a related field as a form of self help. She would probably make an excellent counsellor An alternate option that should be considered is going to self help groups. You could probably find one in the area and go with her. It sounds like the important thing is that she does go to counselling. One additional way to present that is professional therapists often go to therapy and recieve supervision from other therapists inorder to work on themself. That makes them a better therapist. Some licenced therapists get what is called psychoanalytic training where they see a therapist for several years and that usually qualifyies them for becoming a better therapsit as well as a higher credential/licencure and an increased earning capacity.

So I was on craigslist. I ran across a 1979 Camaro Z28. The car was totally redone in a new 350 crate engine was devote it as well as 2001. The vehicle has new leaf springs, suspension bushings and wheels onto it. The newest engine has just under 45,000 kilometers on it also. $5500 is being asked by the vendor. Ive am not displeased and driven it. The car seems to not be weak and is of top quality. It'd only be brought out on great times, possibly within the summer, easily were to acquire this vehicle. The car would be 35 years old so im accepting its deemed a classic year. What would have been a great estimation for 50yr old man in California to possess this sort of a-car that is rarely motivated. Per year, the automobile is who is fit, just a little decay and probably wouldnt even view 1000 miles. Just curious for a few insight.


What would be cheaper to cover to get a 16 year old 2003 lancer evo?
What will be cheaper to insure for a 2003 lancer evo that is 16 year old or even a 2008 subaru wrx i get excellent qualities i live with my parents if desired what one would be cheaper to ensure and i may enhance the deductible.


Is it illegal in al to WOn't present insurance information?
An organization truck struck my left automobile in a parking lot the driver remaining note with manager of enterprise stating where he worked,what moment he hit my auto and spot in parking lot,today company owner is refusing to share with me who his insurance company is,the driver also wrote down his title


How to lower my auto insurance, driver. that is youthful?
I am 18 this season going 19, and i want to know I - can probably produce my insurance cheaper, legally. I got my pass plus which can be meant to cut the value down by way of a touch, but I Have identified most internet evaluation websites don't ask in case you have realized pass plus, therefore would it be excellent to acquire a quote online SUBSEQUENTLY ring up and attempt hit the cost along? Likewise what else could I do to slice the charge down, legally?


Will it however affect my insurance rates in Colorado basically had my DUI expunged?
Within 2009's spring I was convicted of a DUI. I plead guilty, served my time and I was able to get it expunged through the court process. So now in the event you have a look at my report about the court website that is outstanding it displays dismissed as opposed to responsible. I had been wondering if it is nonetheless shown by my actual DMV driving history and my insurance rates can remain substantial?","1446336621"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Warning: dubiously verified opinions ahead. 

I don't know that it's black communities as much as very poor communities.  Poverty, especially urban poverty, breeds crime and a culture of mediocrity.  When people do achieve success despite their environment, they have to contend with being called a sellout, forgetting where they came from, etc.  

People are more comfortable with what they know, and seeing success can be uncomfortable.  

There are definitely some race specific reasons, too.  We aren't that far away from the civil rights movement, and black communities were definitely targeted by the police forces in the eighties and nineties.  Obviously that leads to mistrust of the police.  So not only do you have crime due to poverty, but the victims don't feel comfortable going to the cops.  And the criminals know this.  Add that to all of the adults who have personally seen friends targeted, or been targeted themselves.  So they raised their children to be fearful of cops, and occasionally antagonistic.  

It's not as much about skin color as people think.  Black refugees from Africa, black immigrants in general, tend to do much better than black individuals born in America.  The cultural baggage simply isn't there.  ","1446336621"
"evenewbies","t5_2tkgx","Ehh, sort of? When a new originating WH spawns (non K162) it's end point is determined, but not spawned. It used to be the case that once anyone initiated warp to that signature it's K162 would spawn. Now you can warp to the signature and bookmark it without opening it. That said, it does open, and the K162 spawns if someone jumps through from the originating side, or if it hasn't already been opened by a player after 4 hours the K162 will show up on it's own. This means that after you roll your statics closed you have ~4 hours of ""safety"" except from new inbound holes, at which point you will need to reroll your holes if you want to continue to remain isolated.","1446336622"

OK....Seriously, are you asking me for a celebrity name ?

I guess I could try to figure it out but I think it's not a good question.

I think you are falling into a line of thinking in which the more beautiful the girl is, the more handsome the guy has to be for her to give him a chance.

Maybe that kind of thing is true in High School. But as people grow up, appearance is not the only important thing... especially to women.

Women look for a lot of things that men don't care as much about....

She thinks...

Is he smart, is he funny, is he going to be successful, is he a good dresser, will he cheat on me, is he a good listener, would he be a good father, how tall is he, is he athletic, does he have a good body,  do my friends &amp; family like him, how does he treat me......... etc.

And yes..... Is he good looking is definitely part of it.

The good looking guys have a head start on women. But the guys who aren't as good looking can break through enough to be given a chance.... which is why there are a lot of gorgeous women who are dating or married to average looking guys.

And one more thing.... It just so happens that you are a handsome guy !!!  

Just get a better haircut !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :):)","1446336622"

"marriedredpill","t5_32dvh","I made her see a therapist for the first time in her life. I told her she was taking her issues out on me and that was unacceptable and that she could either deal with them or deal with me leaving. That was a bit before I found TRP so some inadvertent dread there. She went to a few until she found one she liked and kept going. It took a while but eventually it really helped her put it behind her and it's helped our sex life and overall relationship. Money well spent.

Otherwise I pretty much apply textbook TRP/MRP. In fact I've applied it pretty aggressively, I didn't follow BPP's advice at all. I read MMSLP, hit the gym, ignored her with great prejudice whenever she wouldn't put out, friended girls on facebook, went out with other people more often, got a hair cut, dressed nicer, got a new higher paying job, gamed her and fucked her aggressively, yadda yadda. She loves to be dominated. She loves when I pound her until she's sore. She likes it when I slap my dick on her face and ass. We're working on anal. She actually said she wanted me to hit her but was too scared to ask me during sex... Not sure if I would go there... She's really turning into a freak lately though so TRP works.","1446336623"

"CCW","t5_2s4mc","&gt; DO NOT shoot someone's dog before it leaves their property, come on. That's absurd, and you probably would end up getting charged and/or sued for it, deservedly. No matter how annoying it is and how much it pisses you off, you can't just run by and shoot someone's dog who's just (aggressively) protecting their own property.

I don't know where people got the idea that I was going to shoot the dog on the owner's property. The distance between me and the sidewalk was maybe thirty feet, and from the sidewalk to where the dog was on the porch was maybe fifty. As soon as the dog started losing his shit and took off, I grabbed my gun as a PRECAUTION. The dog stopped, so I did nothing. If the dog had *left their property* it probably would've gotten shot, **which is what any sensible concealed carrier would do.**

The dog was hauling ass, there was no fence, and no visible lead. I drew as a precaution. This would be the second time I've had a dangerous dog that should be put down charge at me. The first one *broke the lead* and would've killed my dog before the trashy owners came out and called the dog off, and then yelled at me for 'messing with their dog'.

What is it, the twenty foot rule for drawing a gun vs. someone with a knife? Pretty sure a dog can clear that much faster than a person.

&gt;hateful language towards ""rednecks""

Unfortunately, to me, 'redneck' is a despicable culture and I hate anything and everything to do with it. I put rednecks in a category of person that is shared with hood-trash gangbangers. I've spent a significant portion of my life amongst *true* rednecks - and it's a culture synonymous with dangerous, stupid people who are trumped up on 'macho' bullshit, talk about fighting and want to start fights over stupid shit, and the kind of people who are complete assholes and do things like 'roll coal' or (on the exact same street I encountered this dog, and only about two months ago), driving their trucks as close to me as possible as I jog to 'scare me' for a laugh (you're supposed to run *against* traffic, this guy came up behind and drove into the other lane and missed me by maybe two feet). They're the kind of people who would own a dangerous-ass dog and chain it up in their yard, and then talk about how sweet their dog is when people complain about dangerous-ass dogs.

[Here's a good example of rednecks doing redneck things.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b23-OxLUkE) It fucking blows my mind that it's considered trendy amongst rural white people to aspire to be these kind of animals.","1446336623"

"paydaytheheist","t5_2t0hx","My second DLC idea was the Cold War Pack. I'd love to see some more Butcher Weapon Packs and Heists due to her being a character/contact that hasn't really been explored too much.

The SVD Dragunov sniper rifle would make a nice addition to the game and maybe for once in a single video game, they make the SVD Dragunov decent. So the SVD Dragunov to those who don't know is a 10 round semi-automatic sniper rifle developed by the Soviet Union in the cold war. It was based off the AK family of weapons. Perhaps similar damage to the Lebensauger .308, but not as much concealment but with other perks or bonuses?

A Makarov would be a rather interesting weapon to add to the game, similar to the Gruber Kurz maybe? An rather unique trait of a Makarov could be that all the unique weapon mods don't hamper the weapon's concealment.

I'd like to see the PKM Pechaneg machine gun in the game and it could have similar attributes to the KSP 58, just with a lower fire rate and higher damage.

A final weapon for the DLC would be the SKS rifle, a semi automatic rifle that could be capable using 3 different magazine capacities. The standard 10 round magazine, the 20 round magazine and the AK's 30 round magazine, all of which also change stability. The rifle could have similar to the M308 but be semi-automatic only.","1446336628"

I'm five feet tall, so if you're taller you could probably do better than that weight loss wise while strength training.

The best thing about weight lifting or strength training while losing weight is that you will notice more desirable physical changes as you lose weight.

When you realise death is so close that you literally have the pills under your sofa (Amitryptyline (8g) cocktail) and your other 2 suicide methods (as backups) in the room next door a lot of realities start to hit like: Why do I have these DVDs? Why do I have Sopanish language learning books? Whats the point in leaving a suicide note - there's nothing after? Why am I thinking about buying a TV when I'll be dead soon? 

Things become infinitely clearer the closer you reach that final decision.","1446336630"

"Chattanooga","t5_2qnd8","I don't know of any, but I went to some NA meetings around here (I'm an atheist) and they were really cool/not pushy about religion. Lots of support there. The god stuff is supposed to be open for interpretation and atheist/agnostic friendly, according to the NA guy I talked to, who was also an atheist. No idea what AA is like around here, though.

Be warned that some speakers will go on and on about God, as in the Judeo-Christian deity, and you just have to put up with it. There's also the serenity prayer, which I would bow my head for, but there's no one saying that you have to be praying to god. Pray to your cat if you'd like. AA and NA will have more people than any explicitly nonreligious alternative, at least in this area, and what counts the most is the emotional support you get from others. Perhaps you should find an AA meeting to attend until you find a secular alternative? It's really not that bad, and I say that as a hardcore atheist.

Best of luck, in any case. If you need someone to talk to about sobriety I'd be glad to lend my support.","1446336632"

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","I think that women do see a small wage gap. Based on studies I've heard, the wage gap (after accounting for other factors, like education and career choice) is about 5%. Now, it's not a foregone conclusion that this is gender discrimination. It's possible that there's a factor which hasn't been included in the analysis. Some people think the 5% gap is based on women being less likely to negotiate for a higher salary when hired. (And feminists then say that women don't negotiate as hard as men because it goes against their socially-taught gender role of being 'nice'.) Who knows. Whatever the case, this is dramatically smaller than the 23% which is generally reported as sexual discrimination. What this says to me is that, when there is discrimination, it's common practice to exaggerate the size of that discrimination.

One thing I've learned, though, is to be skeptical of these kinds of stories. Why? Because there is a particular narrative among feminists, the media, and academia that says that women are unfairly discriminated against. As a result, if a study is done which shows no discrimination or pro-female discrimination, it will get buried. It won't show up in the media. The researchers might not even publish it. This is called the [""file drawer effect""](http://skepdic.com/filedrawer.html).

Further, because academia has a belief about discrimination against women, they will seek to find that conclusion. Why? Because it's a ""good story"" and it confirms (left-leaning) people's pre-existing beliefs about the world. This is *especially* prevalent among feminist researchers. I saw a paper a while back where they did something similar - fictional students with a variety of male/female, white/black/hispanic/asian/indian names sending letters to professors to ask about working with them. The media widely reported the story as ""professors were dramatically more likely to respond to white male students than anyone else"". The reality, though - and I know this because I actually looked up the paper - was that there was very little discrimination against many of fictional students who were not white males. What the study actually found was that, at private universities, white males did have a higher response rate (by about 6% over white females and hispanic females, and larger percentages compared to other gender/racial groups). (Asian and Indian students suffered the lowest response rates - by about 15-20% lower than white males.)

However, at public universities (where the majority of students actually go), white women, hispanic women, and black women had the highest response rates (by about 3%-4%) over white males, hispanic males, and black males. There seemed to be a pro-female bias at public universities. When you combine all the public and private university numbers together, white males, white female, and hispanic females had identical response rates. Did any of this get reported in the media? Nope. They media continued to tout the (fictional) claim that white males were dramatically more likely to get a response than any other gender/racial group. When the lead researcher was interviewed (a woman, by the way), even she continued to push the narrative that white males were privileged over everyone else. But, none of it was true. This made me think that the researcher was a feminist, and she was pushing the standard ""women and minorities are oppressed, white males have it great"" narrative.

It was shocking. It also teaches you to be skeptical about these kinds of reports.","1446336633"

Theyve been drop restricted for far longer than they havent been. Also if you can point to me something that proves that it currently isnt drop restricted that would be nice.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","Reading your post put a lump in MY throat.  Sometimes ex-mo's have such hatred for the church that they will take their anger out on those poor missionary kids.  And that is exactly what they are...kids.  Kids who are only doing what they have been taught, trained, and brainwashed to do.  The amazing thing is that through many heart-to-heart conversations I have had with them, the majority would much rather be doing anything but serving a mission.  However, due to upbringing and parental/familial, girlfriend, etc. pressure...there they are.


For the longest time when the missionaries used to knock on my door I would invite them in and then hammer their religion to them.  That would get me nowhere with them except looking like the ""crazy apostate"" that they had been warned about.  When my son went on his mission and wrote me about the difficulties, hardships, and discouragement he faced each day, something struck me.  I had always hoped that for my son being in a strange land there would be people who would protect him and reach out to him...feed him and offer safe haven.  I asked myself how I could have those expectations if I wasn't willing to offer the same myself.  So I changed.


If I saw the missionaries walking on the street, I pulled over and asked if they needed a lift.  If they were shopping for groceries at the same time as I, I would pay their bill.  When they knocked on my door I opened my house to them.  If I was cooking dinner I made them stay.  If I was going out to eat they came with me.  I explained that they were invited to drop by anytime BUT...we would not be discussing the church.  I made it very clear that if they tried to re-convert me I would try to de-convert them (and that I was better armed).  They ALWAYS respected my wishes and we had some great meals together as well as some great life discussions about their plans for after their missions (school, career, marriage, sex, etc.).


Then for the longest while the missionaries stopped dropping by.  I kind of missed them but...oh well.  My son returned from his mission and would contact the missionaries in his ward to take out to dinner.  They told him that my house had been ""blacklisted"".  Apparently one of the missionaries told another missionary about one night hanging out at my place, eating a great dinner, and watching the NBA playoffs on TV.  He also mentioned that no religion was discussed, no lesson given, and no prayers.  Well, I guess this made it's way back to the mission president...so...no more visits.  But just the other night a pair of new missionaries knocked on my door.  I invited them in and we ate some ice cream and watched the Lakers game.  Haa haaa...perhaps a new cycle has begun.


Good for you and your boyfriend for being kind and inviting to the missionaries.  Do as I do and set an example for them that you don't have to be a member of some cult to be happy, well adjusted, giving and kind people.  ","1446336638"

But then, 10 years later, to have lawyers coming to you like ""hey so you owe a bunch of money for this thing you used"".

I'm sure that's a strange feeling... Like on one hand ""wow this thing really got big"" and on the other hand ""oh my god I've borrowed so much stuff I could be sued for.""

"lifeisstrange","t5_32tf7","I agree for the most part. They really screwed it up by nullifying each and every one of the things you've done throughout the story only to tell you that it's better had you done nothing in the first place. Personally, though, I take a different approach when it comes to how the story should have been like in the first place.

Let's face it - probably only a small percentage of people liked Life is Strange, fell in love with it, and stayed loyal to it because of all the paranormal phenomena going on. What pulled most of us in was the drama and the Rachel Amber mystery. It's not rare for game developers to try and tackle heavy, very delicate topics often considered taboo. We've seen it done before. The thing is - very rarely they've been done right. I can count the games that did it right on one hand. Life is Strange was one of them. 

It was very surprising and very refreshing to see such mature topics handled in such a good, even if a bit flawed, way. I was amazed at how well they were realized, and how much emotion they evoked from me - a tough guy who's never cried at any piece of media and has already seen many a movies touching up on tough subjects. And yet, Life is Strange made me cry. Only once, but it actually made me cry, which I consider a great achievement in my personal view. Not to mention the total emotional devastation it left me with after playing each chapter from 2 onwards. Kate's suicide, Chloe in a wheelchair, asking you to end her life, finding The Dark Room, along with all those creepy photos, finding Rachel's body - those were all really heavy moments that could've been very easily fucked up should Dontnod wanted to add more melodrama to it. Luckily, they didn't do it and it all came out very naturally, adding to the emotional factor.

Another factor that they did well was the moral ambiguity of your choices. They always were very firmly placed in the ""gray area"" of morality - no right and no wrong answers, just the answer **you** think is the right thing to do. Not once and not twice I found myself staring at this eyesore-inducing filtered screen for minutes, deciding on what to do because the choices were always tough. 

In my opinion, Dontnod made a huge, huge mistake by even implementing so much sci-fi/supernatural stuff into the story in the first place because what they ended up with clearly was something they couldn't get creative with, so all they did was ripping *The Butterfly Effect* off and ending the game on an unsatisfying, extremely predictable note. 

It really makes me wonder why didn't they focus on the drama and the crime mystery further, when they managed to do it so well. I hope that when (and if) Season 2 comes out, they'll focus on those aspects more rather than trying to create a full-on sci-fi story because, as we've seen from the entirety of Episode 5, they're not good at it at all.","1446336639"

"VictoriaBC","t5_2rbsy","&gt; They ENTIRELY made an incorrect decision. At minimum they should have released that they made a mistake, ie: on twitter, on their website, etc. and told riders that it would be Sunday schedule instead of the posted Saturday.

That's not an incorrect decision. They didn't sit there and weigh out the pros and cons of posting to social media that there was an error, so they didn't actually make a decision. If you had suggested that to them, I 100% guarantee they would have done so IF they have the power. I have taken BC Transit every day for years and they definitely admit mistakes when they have the opportunity and think of it.

&gt; And the person who works for Transit noticed the same screwups in the guides that were newly released, multiple times. As in the same mistake carried over. From one paper release, to another, to another. That doesn't sound like it's an ""oh we can't update them outside the designated time"" error.

Yeah and of course there is no proof of that.

&gt; Consistent overtime, where people would be making $45-60 an hour, depending how much overtime they have, because of scheduling fuckups? I think it would be cheaper to hire someone else. Maybe someone who knows how to schedule.

Take me for example, I rushed to TH9 then TH10. It'll only take me 16 more weeks to fully max defense, walls and heroes. While lab will take another 20 weeks after that to max, but I've timed it such that all upgrades that I deem useful for myself will finish around the same time as heroes.

Does it max me any less maxed? You'll need to decide on that. 

Point is, there are lab upgrades that are less useful and not prioritised in the current meta, so not upgrading them would not mean that I'm screwed, just that my priorities lie elsewhere.

Here's a list of what I'm least concerned with:
Dragons lvl 3-5, Pekka lvl 2-5, Lightning lvl 5-7, EQ spell lvl 2-4, Valks lvl 3,4

Halloween or Hallowe'en (/ˌhæləˈwiːn, -oʊˈiːn, ˌhɑːl-/; a contraction of ""All Hallows' Evening""), also known as Allhalloween, All Hallows' Eve, or All Saints' Eve, is a yearly celebration observed in a number of countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It initiates the three-day religious observance of Allhallowtide, the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed believers.Within Allhallowtide, the traditional focus of All Hallows' Eve revolves around the theme of using ""humor and ridicule to confront the power of death.""
According to many scholars, All Hallows' Eve is a Christianized feast initially influenced by Celtic harvest festivals,with possible pagan roots, particularly the Gaelic Samhain. Other scholars maintain that it originated independently of Samhain and has solely Christian roots.

Typical festive Halloween activities include trick-or-treating (or the related ""guising""), attending costume parties, decorating, carving pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, visiting haunted attractions, playing pranks, telling scary stories and watching horror films. In many parts of the world, the Christian religious observances of All Hallows' Eve, including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead, remain popular, although in other locations, these solemn customs are less pronounced in favor of a more commercialized and secularized celebration.Because many Western Christian denominations encourage, although most no longer require, abstinence from meat on All Hallows' Eve, the tradition of eating certain vegetarian foods for this vigil day developed, including the consumption of apples, colcannon, cider, potato pancakes, nursery rhyme and soul cakes, halloween song for kids, scary pumpkin

This is one of the reasons why Crimea is so important historically and strategically to Russia.  Crimea was an Ottoman outpost that funneled Slavs into Muslim slavery.  It's been in an unending series of conflicts with Islam/Ottomans/Turkey even to this day.

Cana - storing creatures, attacks, weapons and summoning them from her cards similar to TenTen in Naruto or using the cards like Kuchiki Byakuya's Senbonzakura

Lucy - improve her physical/fighting ability.  Since she can summon allies, maybe learn to strategically fight with them also - summon, desummon, instantly and often

Gray - develop his dynamic ice-make (Lyon's ability.  Right now he only creates static items/weapons)

Laxus - He's pretty awesome as is, but he's lightning, so improve/use his speed and maybe employ more flash (blinding) attacks

Mirajane - Her transformations still maintain part human form.  I'd like to see her transform totally into a demon/creature (possibly making her unrecognizable)

Wendy - since she can control wind, ability to control the air around her opponents.  Suffocate opponents, create tornadoes, slice/cut with air, etc.

Erza - her magic is about equipping armor/weapons...maybe have her the ability to equip/transform into mechanical things (robot style) like Franky in One Piece!

Happy - increase speed and use it to attack, learn the transformation technique from Mirajane and be like Pantherlily

Freed - learn more scripts and use it for attack/defense on the spot instead of preparation like Levy.  Maybe learn more scripts to allow him to transform into other things other than a demon.

Bickslow - trap more souls and incorporate them into more objects.  Those 5 little ""drums"" just aren't doing it.  He could be pretty powerful if there are actually souls that he can only see wandering about.  he can just trap one during battle and put it into a doll or inanimate object and control it.

Evergreen - learn to create objects from her dust, different types of dust for attack/defense, maybe poisonous dust, explosive dust, dust that can transform properties of the environment around her like turn dirt into sand/quicksand

Lisanna - allow her to turn into more ferocious animals and the actual animal, not part animal/human

Elfman - get more transformations, build his body up to be extremely resistant to magic and physical attacks

Gildarts - he's pretty awesome already, considering his magic is pretty strong and his physical abilities are strong.  Don't really know what to improve here.  He's fast, strong, his magic basically cuts, splits, destroys whatever he wants

Bisca and Alzack - bigger guns/cannons/nukes; maybe develop sniper tendencies, like ability to shoot vitals spots at ease, shoot light, different types of objects

Juvia - different types of water properties - poison, thick/molasses water,  hot/cold water, rain, etc.","1446336650"

Perhaps he was abused by his father as a toddler and a little older.
*Every day he would have to do dozens of chores and treat his father like a king. Ash was bullied at school, being beaten up every other day. The boys at school liked aiming for his face. Whenever Ash was too slow at doing chores or talked back to his father, he would be beaten again, now by his own father. Ash's mother simply let everything happen, as she was scared about what would happen to her if she tried to intervene. At the age of 10 however, Ash's mother couldn't take anymore and ran away to Kanto with her son. Ash, having brain damage due to many concussions, simply forgot about his father and instead focused on delusional dreams of controlling imaginary friends he called Pokemon. He wandered off from home, traveling throughout Kanto and being helped by many thanks to those pitying his crazy demeanor. Some even pretended to battle him with so-called Pokemon. Now he's in his twenties and still acts like as if he was 10. Ash has traveled through many regions with his friends protecting him, supplying him with food and money. His mother still worries about his condition to this day...*

The plot makes no sense, there are some very, very bizzare scenes in there and holy shit the main female character (forgot her name) has got to be one of the most annoying and useless females in history and drags this movie so down for me. Didn't particulary care for the kid either, the action was subpar to Raiders and Crusaders and the villain was weird as well. BUT compared to Kingdom it's also so much more memorable and has a ton of unforgattable and great scenes: the minecarts, heart ripping, the dinner scene, the final bridge scene. That doesn't make it a better movie, but it sure makes it more fun.

I've only actually met one such person in the flesh, and from what I've gathered over the years, he only leaves his apartment for work or to go to comic/anime conventions and video-game tournaments. One time, him and I were both part of a bachelor party at a local night-club and he was *super* fucking awkward...vacillating between acting really cagey/wallowy and throwing out some remarkably douchebaggy comments to random girls walking past us at the club. I myself am nothing close to an extrovert, but his disastrous vibe made me wish I could sink into the floor and ooze away. To me, it made a lot of sense when I started to see him railing on about SJWs and throwing out MRA talking points on our friends' Facebook threads a few years down the road. Now of course I'm probably oversimplifying the context here...as outside of internet spaces like Reddit and the Escapist boards, these people (thankfully) seem as rare as white elk.","1446336656"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

If you are using a non-UAE airline then you can just get a visa from a tourist agency. I've used one once and it was really easy. If you need that service then I can look into which agency I used, just let me know. The airline route is probably the easiest though.

"SandersForPresident","t5_2zbq7","I don't know if either is okay. The problem is that the state or municipality funds the facilities that you are talking about and they have to remain impartial with regard to politics. They can't be seen as endorsing any candidate and allowing someone to put fliers on any part of their property (including the parking lot) will probably draw their ire. And it would look bad on the very cause that you are trying to promote. 

You might be able to get away with grocery store parking lot flyering - but you still run into the issue of it being on private property. 

I definitely agree that getting the word out there is a great idea. But just be mindful of what property (and who owns it) that you are flyering on.

"architecture","t5_2qhae","/u/Vermillionbird hit the nail on the head there but here's some tips for you.

&gt; I want to look into internships, because I believe I should start networking and making connections as quickly as possible

This is a good reason to get an internship, don't get me wrong. But do not go in as a just-graduated second-year student expecting to get a nice internship at any highly-reputable firm doing glamorous work. Chances are, you'll be doing lots of errands. My first internship included running to the supermarket to get toilet paper and office supplies, organizing our library and creating a catalog for it, and re-organizing the flat file cabinet. It also included calling and meeting engineers, suppliers, lighting manufacturers, and I.T. companies for troubleshooting, pricing estimates, setting dates for meetings with the architect. Most of what you'll do is listen, take notes, watch, and do a lot of secretarial-type work. Certainly don't expect to be jumping into fulfilling your IDP hours for 45 hours every week at your first internship especially after your second year.

Oh also, a tip about networking and making connections: be humble about where you go to school. Don't consistently bring up how you went to a top-ranked school, because

* since you don't know how to use digital technology (and chances are you don't know much about building systems or structural design yet), your place of education will seem laughable to those who have to deal with real-world issues

* believe it or not, the ""top 10"" school shtick is a bit of a sham. That is to say, when you get out, you're going to be stuck doing the same things and having the same general knowledge as anyone in your peer group regardless of where they got their degree. And in architecture, the thing that counts is really how skilled you are in design, critical thinking and analysis, and actual production.

&gt; Part of the thing holding me back is that we have not been taught any computer programs in college yet

You're not going to like this answer, but don't blame the school for things you haven't learned how to do. You know how to use the internet. You know how to watch online videos. I'm sure your school at least *has* a computer lab, so you can teach yourself how to draw on CAD. Other programs you'll likely use in your internship when you're not doing the above-described tasks include:

* Photoshop
* Sketchup
* Maybe MAYBE Revit (if the firm you work for has a license and you can show that you know how to use it well then they will want you).

&gt; I just want to know how I should go about contacting firms and inquiring about internships

When I was applying for my first internship, I just searched up every firm within a 30-mile radius that had licensed architects on staff and called them during their office hours saying exactly this:

[receptionist answers] 
&gt; ""Hi, my name's *xRILLIANx*, I have an inquiry for [Mr./Ms. Firm Owner]. May I speak to him/her?"" 

[IF Yeah sure I'll transfer you, then picked up by said Owner; IF not, say thank you and ask if you can exchange emails or have the owner give you a call at their convenience] 

&gt; ""Hello, my name's *xRILLIANx*, I'm an architecture student at Syracuse University in New York, I'm wondering if you're considering any openings for an intern in the summer?"" 

[They might say something like ""we might have a few spots, give me more information]

""Well, I'm rising third-year student at SU, we do a lot of urban mixed-use design, I'm familiar with a lot of computer programs, and I can do some hand-drafting as well. I have a portfolio if you'd like me to send it to you, and my classes end on May 10, so if you'd consider it, I can meet you in person with a copy of my full portfolio and we can talk more.

[Usually regardless of what you say here, they'll probably give you an email to send a portfolio to, so you just write it up, remember to remind them of your conversation, and attach a SMALL pdf. If it takes too long to download, your potential employer will be much less likely to take you seriously].

&gt; ""Thank you, I look forward to your correspondence.

Mind you, I did this probably 40 times over the spring semester before my summer internship, and then went and visited another 20 firms (some I'd emailed, some I hadn't) in person just to drop by with a similar conversation and goal when I returned home for the summer after classes.

The important takeaway here is to remember that you're a second-year student. On the whole, you're not that valuable. Most second-year students have to be taught everything in a firm setting, taking up valuable time and resources, because they really don't know how to properly detail walls yet, or how to take into account the fact that  the ceiling is really 3' deep to account for ducts, lighting, and ceiling tiles. Be humble, and constantly ask questions. Your employer will probably be much happier that you took 30 seconds to clarify something before spending 2 hours in CAD creating a wrong drawing.","1446336665"

OP, quite honestly, if you will take advice from a woman who's been in the same situation as your ex-g/f: one of the things that likely drew her to you was that you had your life together. Right now, you don't, so a trip over to see her - 9 times out of 10 - is not going to change her mind. You don't say why you broke up, but it may not even be all about your situation. 

Regardless you need to focus on your situation and get your life back on track. Getting money to see her is probably going to be money wasted, because you are in the same boat and can't see her ongoingly, can't move ahead with future plans... if you'll excuse me saying so (and I'm trying to do so in the nicest possible way), this gesture is going to be pointless and just set you back even further in your own life. You gotta get back on track with your life in arenas besides her, and let the chips fall where they may, for now.

Honestly I'd even be hesitant to donate at all, because who knows why the breakup was? We'd be effectively helping you stalk her - can you see how that might seem to be the case? She broke up with you. Stay for now. Build yourself back up. Focus on you, not her. You can't change her.","1446336668"

1) sex/pornography crimes (especially related to minors)

2) possession crimes

So it's not that unreasonable to say what he said.  

Hypothetically, if you filmed a sex act with a minor, even if you had a very reasonable basis to believe they were of age and able to consent, you could be easily be prosecuted for possession of child pornography.

Actually, 18 USC 2252 was almost much worse.  See US v. XCitement Video, Scalia's dissent (https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-723.ZD.html).  

Luckily for the defendant in this case (some guy who shipped pornographic videos with Traci Lords not knowing she was underage), the majority decided that ""knowingly"" meant that he had to know it contained underage performers.  As Scalia points out, that isn't actually the most logically sensible interpretation of the statute.

Basically, I'm saying that when it comes to child pornography laws, you shouldn't be so confident that you'll be protected by mens rea.

"skiing","t5_2qig7","&gt; Many people around me do backcountry skiing in water-resistant soft-shell clothes and are more than happy with it.

As do I; I'm a backcountry skier and an ice climber. I put tons of mileage on technical outerwear in very demanding conditions. I can honestly say that lift-serviced alpine ski and snowboard clothing is a joke. All ""style"", little substance. Heavy, bulky, and not very functional most of the time.

The purpose of water-resistant softshells is to breathe, shed water to the limits of what is possible without a membrane, absorb little water, and *DRY QUICKLY*. Fabrics containing cotton will not do this as well. Many manufacturers avertise poly/cotton blends as ""fast drying"", but they are really comparing to 100% cotton. I can honestly say, cotton blend fabrics will be inferior in every way under demanding conditions. 

Does cotton wear better? Probably not, they're just using a higher denier fabrics. You can do the same with nylons (e.g. various types of packcloth, such as Cordura). Technical garments often sacrifice durability for form-fitting flexibility and light weight, but synthetics are not inherently less durable.

EDIT: Browsing Fjällräven's site, it's clear that what they make is overwhelmingly retro, not unlike Duluth Trading Company in the US. Starting with the intention to achieve retro styling is not how you design the *most functional* articles of outerwear. Starting with a need, and working backwards to see which features best address that need is. If you want to recreate the clothing styles of the 1960s, your clothing line has no place in serious winter recreation - at least not mine. I'm not saying there's no market for it, but I am saying that Fjällräven's  target market is less informed, and engages in less demanding applications than, say, the target market of Arc'teryx or Black Diamond.","1446336676"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Ellie May. 
My dog of 10 years passed away last week from a mix of liver failure, intestinal disease, and old age. 
She had gone to the vet just the day before for tests. She seemed okay, but did vomit earlier in the day. 
Then we noticed she had stopped breathing.

We panicked and rushed her to the vet. I held her limp body in my arms while my wife had a mental breakdown. We sped down streets recklessly clinging onto a shred of hope I knew really wasn't there. 

She was her childhood pet. Together since before birth, constantly checking on the breeder and the progress, then visiting multiple times a week before getting to take her home. When we married, she said they were a package deal, and I wholeheartedly accepted that. 
I raised her more like a daughter than a dog. 
She stayed strong through uteral cancer. 
I remember staying up at night to make sure her shallow breathing then kept constant. And she recovered well, though she needed thyroid medication for energy now. 
She played a lot, and eventually began to lose feeling in her legs, like German shepherds commonly do. 
So she took some steroids to help the swelling, and still played in her wheelchair, to the end. 
And now she's gone. 
I dug a grave in the middle of the night for her that day. Under her favorite tree. 
And it still hurts. 

I can't think of that name any differently now. And I'm not sure if I ever will without at least feeling a slight pain. I know it will get better over time.. But I don't think it will go away. ","1446336676"

Advice? You need to be very specific with the type of interest you have in the IT world. It's difficult to master the ""jack of all trades"" because there is so much out there to learn and keep up with. You have Linux, Windows, Mac, etc. 
Networking, Network security, etc... 
Focus on what you want to learn and what you want to achieve (a long term goal). I'm a system admin and doing software development as well (on my spare time). There are plenty of things in this field of work to keep you interested. ","1446336677"
"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","I've signed up for the beta but haven't got the game yet...  Having watched some footage though (from a different streamer) there are a few things that worry me:

1. Reload times are very fast and seem to be clip based...

2. No ammo management...  You have infinite ammo...

3. Bad silhouettes, which will get worse when new heros are released...

4. Lots of lighting changes on the maps...

Admittedly I'm comparing Overwatch to TF2 but I can see these things being a problem long term...  There is a lot to like in Overwatch though, like short respawn times, the progression and kill cams (gets around the ""wtf just killed me"" although a lot of the time it seems like you still don't really know)...  I like the thought of the abilities and special attacks but some of them seem to be ""press button, get free kills"" which is just frustrating and removes the skill component...  But at least they don't have a hat fixation... yet...

"webdev","t5_2qs0q","Well, I think I might have expressed myself wrong in the topic :))
I do have a computer engineer degree and I currently work as a full-stack engineer and do some DevOps. I wok mostly with Python.

Things seem to be moving towards Javascript (Node.JS in backend) and cool frameworks in the frontend Angular / React.

I always like to be learning new stuff, for instance, I learned Docker on my own and could use it in projects and it really provided me value instead of what I was using before.

All that said, I've finished the first part of a machine learning specialisation in Coursera and I am thinking if I should continue it (it's 6 parts, I've completed the 1st) or study more JS or more devops.

The thermodynamic laws would be a problem if we had to make the matter before we fused it.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).

Tell them that between the three of them, they need to get at least one other car up to school to shoulder some of the burden or the free ride express will have to come to an end.  Period.

After Newton, there was broad bi-partisan support for dealing with the clear issues of Mental Health. No deal unless Obama got everything he wanted. 
 
I understand the tactic. Why actually make the country better by making incremental progress when, by doing so, you lose access to using the issue to berate your enemy (other Americans, the Republicans), or using it polarize voters, or using it do demonize your opponent, or use it as a wedge issue in election advertisements.

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","I'm about halfway through the book, and while I think that people are way to harsh on it, I don't like it.

My biggest complaint is the characters. They feel like cardboard cutouts to me and I really don't care about any of them. Jas is a lone-wolf bounty hunter looking to be part of something bigger than herself. Sinjir is a disillusioned Imperial loyalty officer who's decided to join the rebels...for some reason. Temmin is a kid whose mad at his mom. Norra is a soldier with PTSD whose loyalty is split between her family and the New Republic. Wedge is just kinda there. I do like Sloane, however, but a part of that may be because she was in A New Dawn.

So far none of the characters seem to have any real depth to them. Except maybe Norra, but every scene with her and Temmin feels played-out.

I feel like not enough time is spent with the characters, and not enough information is given about their thoughts and motivations. They all feel like they are just kind of around, to be swept along in whatever direction the plot decides to move.

I do like the interludes, however, and I'm willing to forgive Wendig's writing style, although I do find it clunky and distracting.

I feel like the book has potential, and I'll probably read the next book in the trilogy.","1446336688"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","I'll respectfully disagree.

It's totally unnecessary to tell people that their experience in life isn't true or isn't important. OP is basically saying: ""black people say that people dressing up in black face is offensive, I'm here to say, they are wrong it is *not* offensive."" That isn't how an adult acts, that's the kind of playground bullying of a child.

Even from a cynical point of view, the kind of content that OP is posting is alienating non-white and queer people from **your** movement. Libertarians have some great ideas, but they aren't going to go anywhere if you keep alienating the kind of people who you need on your side...

All this rhetoric is predicated around the idea that ""people are just too darn sensitive"" yet those same people turn around and act super sensitive about not having the ""freedom"" to say insensitive, racist, homophobic crap without someone calling them out. 

The PC culture *is* too sensitive in my opinion, on both ""sides"" it would seem.

You should sit down with your wife and explain that this was a horrible idea, and you want to discontinue the open relationship. Hopefully she can completely let go of all contacts she has made, and stay 100% loyal to you. I am concerned about this because it seems like since she wasn't able to stay loyal before the open relationship, she might have an even harder time doing it after that's stopped.

"projectzomboid","t5_2sdk8","Axe is easily better. While the bat has a little more push back (it's really not much) the axe's max damage is way higher than the bat and the axe also has a higher minimum damage and a higher crit chance. The bat in theory has a higher durability, but requires more use to kill, meaning you'll probably get more real use out of the axe thanks to the fact that it can often 1 hit kill whereas the baseball bat rarely 1 hit kills. This translates into the axe killing Zeds faster meaning less overall risk and less chance of getting swamped than with the bat.

The only real plus of the bat over the axe is it's lower weight, but that is an easy pay off considering.

Baseball Bat vs Nailed Bat, the difference is basically slightly higher damage for less durability, it's what I consider a really balanced trade off, but the axe is far superior to both and personally I never make nailed bats because I favour durability over damage on them.

Even if it *was* the best answer (it's not, but assuming for the sake of the argument that it was - the **best** answer is quantum mechanics, because we know that quantum mechanics is real, that our universe operates according to it, and quantum mechanics can create a universe from nothing) that *still* wouldn't make it a **good** answer.

And on the toys theres the silicone disk at the base? Slide the toy through the metal ring then lock it into the harness and you're good to go.

As far as a toy to enjoy together, luckily the gspot and prostate are sort of the same location (relative to entrance) so toys for one will work for the other and vice versa. However, having to boil/properly disinfect every time you want to go from one to another partner could be a real pain. If you've only had a prostate plug then its worth going onto the lower end of the spectrum in terms of size and probably getting yourself a regular cone shaped plug for  warmup and training.

"grammar","t5_2qhwy","Some authorities (e.g. Trask) say the comma is required after the *but*. Most authorities don't mention the issue. It's very common not to have a comma there. Here's what Fowler says about it ([more here](http://www.bartleby.com/116/402.html)):  

&gt; Laxity comes in when we choose, guided by nothing more authoritative than euphony, to stop an adverbial phrase or adverbial clause, but not to stop it at both ends, though it stands in the middle of its sentence. This is an unmistakable offence against logic, and lays one open to the condemnation of examiners and precisians. But the point we wish to make is that in a very large class of sentences the injury to meaning is so infinitesimal, and the benefit to sound so considerable, that we do well to offend. The class is so large that only one example need be given:

&gt;&gt;    But with their triumph over the revolt, Cranmer and his colleagues advanced yet more boldly.—J. R. Green.

&gt; The adverbial phrase is *with their triumph over the revolt*. *But* does not belong to it, but to the whole sentence. The writer has no defence whatever as against the logician; nevertheless, his reader will be grateful to him. The familiar intrusion of a comma after initial *And* and *For* where there is no intervening clause to justify it, of which we gave examples when we spoke of overstopping, comes probably by false analogy from the unpleasant pause that rigid punctuation has made common in sentences of this type.

There is no way this is standard for all devil fruits, espically parmecia since they vary so much. Are you saying that Hancock awakening would be her creating stone objects from anything and bending it like Doffy does? Are you saying that Luffy will be able to turn anything to rubber and control it like Doffy does? We've gotten like a page telling us about Devil Fruit Awaking  that is no where near enough to know it."")

Her fruit is called the love love fruit so it should have something more to do with love then just everything being shaped like hearts. Yes it's clear that she can turn people and objects to stone but there are more parts of her devil fruit. Her pistol kiss didn't turn Luffy to stone in the area it hit him and it had haki in it as it was able to harm Luffy. Now we don't know if it didn't turn him to stone because he was Luffy or if it doesn't turn them to stone which means there is a another part to her abilities. We don't even know if people are falling for her just because she is pretty or if the fruit had some sort of passive effect which makes people fall in love with her.

When Hancock attacked with Perfume femur in a circle everyone who turned completely to stone had hearts in their eyes. It could be that she makes it for a second but since they are frozen they can't change.

Tbh I don't know about it either. I'm just giving possible reasons why it might not be. This is all assumptions I've made from the series which is the same as you're doing. It's not fact it's just a strong assumption.","1446336700"
"canada","t5_2qh68","Well, most people have to move to go to university anyways, the only difference is that you can't go home every weekend which isn't the end of the world. And if you're going from Ontario to Newfoundland (the most extreme price difference), you could potentially save about $5600/year in tuition, or $22400 over four years at this year's price, which will work out to even more because Ontario's (and everyone else's) tuition is increasing at a faster rate than Newfoundland's. I really don't think you'll pay $22400 in travel expenses over four years. If you go to university while staying with your parents, you'll almost certainly save money as opposed to going to Newfoundland, but if you have to move anyways, it really does make financial sense to go to MUN. Of course many other factors come in to play while choosing a school, but MUN really seems like a good option money-wise, travel and all.

It was determined to be a gas check, which were first used in 1905 until 1940. These clues helped investigators pinpoint the era in which the man had been killed.[32] Further clues to the man's identity were found when the mandible was removed for dental analysis.

Suppose she wins a car for each guess she gets correct. Then she should say tails, because this gives her a 50% chance of winning two cars vs a 50% chance of winning one car if she says heads.

If she wins a car only if she gets both guesses right, then it doesn't matter what she says as long as she picks one answer and sticks with it.

In the first case each awakening counts as one game, in the second case each flip counts as one game.","1446336707"

One very good way to find interesting companies is to go on Callisto and check out the attendees at the EECS career/internship fairs. You can often find a really good list of tech companies and apply directly through their websites. There's also an internship fair coming up next week. I'd suggest you apply to as many of them as you can and resume-drop the rest online.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Been using hand cannons since the beta. And if you think they're not meta now, you should have tried using them against stupid high impact shingen-c's that could kill you before you could pull off your second shot. 

That aside, what I've found is that for pvp you're better off looking for a quick rate of fire. Even low impact HCs can kill with 2 shots to the head and one to the body. If you decide to run a low RoF HC, you're time to kill drops drastically, (like to a full second) but two headshots will make you're target one hit absolute. So low a silimar's wrath pre-patch could finish your target off in one shot to the head. 

As for sights, I would definitely recommend the Sureshot IS. Quick to aim and high aim assist. It's like they just decided to make a sight that was the best of literally anything you could want. That's just my opinion though.

This section is purely my own opinion, but I feel any pvp hand cannon main (aside from last word) should use a sniper as well as the hand cannon. The synergy is just so strong between them. One shot to the body with a sniper, a quick switch to a HC and you can down them in one more shot to the body. If this is the playstyle you choose I would definitely recommend trying to find range perks. With recent nerfs, HCs range drop off almost make you feel like you're trying to fire jellybeans at any opponent that's too far away.

If you can take anything from this, then good. Just please remember that this is all my opinion after using them myself. Honestly you can probably find much more educated opinions at r/CruciblePlaybook","1446336715"

And there's so much room for comeback as well! I just got beaten by a team that was 3k points behind mine (slightly our fault for denying entire team a couple of times...).

"GGdiscussion","t5_3a3as","&gt; Do you remember when Nintendo was airing ads for the Wii? They were largely not targeted at stereotypical gamers. They didn't target the standard demographics, they targeted girls and women, families, even the elderly. They targeted all the groups that tend not to play games because that's a mostly ingored, untapped market.

So I ask, how did developers go for these harassers as their audience? You respond about cultivating audiences by using Nintendo as an example, how do other developers do that for these audiences Leigh says they don't have to?

&gt;Is it our responsibility to help all these players [avoid toxic behavior]? And the simple answer is yes

Do you feel most companies are inadequate then at doing such things? It's not like Riot is the first company to have such a system and they've had it for how long as well? Aren't the messages sent by these articles then just redundant and useless since most people were already doing this stuff?

&gt;This is much the same for games. Games are better when we can get more unique viewpoints and ideas informing their design decisions. When you have a mostly homogeneous demographics in the pool of developers, you're going to tend to get fewer unique ideas that might lead to interesting styles of play or interesting stories.

So are ""straight males"" or single/homogeneous demographics more likely to be/create harassers then? Because you go and list SU as your example of diversity, yet right now there is a giant issue with the fanbase causing another member to attempt suicide. SU doesn't have those factors that these games due or homogeneous demographics, yet here we have damage being done that is worse than some person raging in a video game.

So is there a link, because it feels like you aren't really addressing the question.","1446336718"

Keyword in that article is ""Could be 750B NOK"", over the whole life, now, the state budget is currently 1200B NOK. Let's assume that the average immigrant is going to live 30 years, that means that it'll cost on average 25B per year, or 1.6% of the current budget. This is also the worst case scenario, [Finansavisen](http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Finansavisen-Syriske-flyktninger-kan-gi-milliardregning-8176097.html) calculated 430B NOK, but I guess that's not worth considering. Yes I know they only did it for 100 000 syrians, but they came to a number that is still 18% less per syrian.

This year, the budget is running on a combined surplus of 205B NOK, [page 46](http://www.statsbudsjettet.no/upload/Statsbudsjett_2016/dokumenter/pdf/stmeld.pdf), this number is just from the interest of the pension fund, increases in property values or stock markets are not taken into account. Next you'll tell me that the military (49.7B NOK) is going to ruin the country and bankrupt the future.

The teacher started talking about different parts of the cell. She talked loud so I figured I'd just let this one slip out and no one would hear it. I adjusted myself on the seat and got ready to exhale through my ass. I relaxed my core and let it out. But I was deceived... This was no small fart, but a typhoon. I could swear my ass lifted up from the seat a little, and I'm a big guy so that's incredible. One girl screamed, another sleeping student woke up in terror. All eyes were on me. I panniced as my gas began filling the room. And oh God did it stink... But it got worse... The rumbling in my lower abdomen became more violent. The poop was comming and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I had poped the cork and this bottle of wine was gonna explode. In shear panic and fear I screamed ""run! You're all going to die!"" I had no idea where it even came from, and I didn't care, I needed to find a bathroom. All eyes were still on me as I waddled out of the classroom. The teasing and laughter came at me like bullets, but I pressed on towards the door like a sailor in a store, crop dusting the whole way. I barely made it to the bathroom in time, before I even sat down the shit began exploding violently out of my ass. I didn't return to class for 3 days out of embarrassment. ","1446336719"

"AlanMoore","t5_2syje","My favorite:

&gt; What are your biggest fears personally, and for the future?

&gt; &gt; Alan Moore: You ask what personally frightens me, and without wishing to sound at all tough or hard-boiled, I’d have to say that I really can’t think of anything. From my perspective, both fear and desire are reactive constructs that are rarely helpful to our situation and in many cases get in the way. To some extent, they’re both different faces of the same thing – our desire for a partner perhaps being equivalent to our fear of loneliness, or our desire for wealth and success being equal to our fear of poverty and failure – and because we project both of them as so huge and looming on our internal screens, it’s possible for us to end up paralysed and unable to do the things we need to do to achieve of goals in life. Much as someone might have an all-consuming desire to be, say, a successful writer, if his or her converse fear of being rejected prevents them from ever sending any work to a publisher for consideration, then they will never be able to fulfil whatever potential they may have had as a human being, self-sabotaged by their own fears; their own longings. For my own part, I attempt to be someone who has no axe to grind: a person who is neither afraid of anything, nor particularly wants anything. I feel that this attitude has served me well in a world where the only two blunt and primitive tools that any authority appears to have the wits to use are threats and temptation; sticks and carrots. A few moments’ consideration makes it clear that sticks can very easily be set on fire, and that you’ve probably never liked carrots that much anyway.

The clipboard does charge on the base if the base is plugged into power.

The clipboard can be charged directly (which is probably one reason they don't have an emergency battery-to-battery charge as if there is power just plug in the clipboard).

It is to my understanding that a non-profit doesn't necessarily mean a charity, it can stand for an organization that is established for a purpose other than profit making. I am not sure what the petting zoo falls under, but I don't think it is a commercial business. I do know that setting up a coffee shop in the park would be a no go with the currents bylaws that are set in place. This article talks about a the bylaw, but without much detail.

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","I don't know how old you are, but your life is not what you're seeing right now. One thing you've got to realize is that there are a lot of people who feel like you including me.

I cannot give you advice based on what little I've read, but one thing applies to everyone: We are all just results of our brain's chemical make up, even if you believe that your identity and life experiences is what is making things shitty right now. People like you and me don't belong in this world, because we don't think like others. If I were to give you a ""happy drug"" right now, you would be happy and see the world in a different light, be encouraged to go out and do more, and be a 'normal' person etc... I'm not saying you should take drugs or medication, but you have to realize that point. I'm not going to lie to you, the world is a shitty place full of shitty people, but it still changes according to how you think/look at it. So get better for you so you can have a better experience. Fuck everyone else and how they connect to you, don't care about that right now.

Don't lose hope. Try to figure out what's wrong with you and why you feel so much hate. Have you ever tried therapy? Have you considered that maybe you have some sort of personality disorder?  If you do have one, then that would be easy to solve as you will begin to understand why you think the way you think. You will also begin to see that there are other 'copies' of you who feel the same hate and disgust.

If you haven't done any of that, then it's not fair for you to just give up. If your mom is willing to do anything for you, you should ask her to take you to therapy. I know there's a part of you that even hates to get better, but trust me man. Just suck it up, and go do the annoying therapy thing. It's only annoying in your head right now, but things can really and actually get better.","1446336725"

"MakeupAddiction","t5_2rww2","You should look into circle lenses in general if you like the look, they are wider than normal lenses and can really change your look dramatically and allow you to use different colors and techniques than you normally would. My natural eyes looked fine with this look, but the contacts make them look bigger despite all the heavy black around them and while adding some color to make them stand out from my face, otherwise my dark eyes made it too dark overall. I really liked how Charlize Theron's eyes were lightened and saturated in post-processing to make them glow from her face in Mad Max so I tried to emulate that IRL.

You can find good Japanese and Korean lenses in prescription and Plano (non prescription) with tons of colors at pinkyparadise and honeycolor! I've ordered from Pinky Paradise a few times and the lenses are always good but their service is a bit iffy because they run out of stock a lot after you order something listed as ""in stock"" and you have to change the style via email without knowing what's in stock. These were my fourth or fifth choice, I wanted to buy violet lenses and they had none in my prescription in the styles I wanted so I just went for a green one instead. Still holding out for violet ones! I did buy them during their pre Halloween sale though so they probably had a surge of orders to fill.

They're fairly comfortable if you're used to wearing contacts but get dry and hot after about 8 hours. I've been wearing them all day since I wore them to work but I'm going to a party... ","1446336732"

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","I don't think the conjunction of 1., 2., and 3. is the majority view. Most people do deny 3. No one's arguing for this viewpoint, unless on some consequentialist grounds where ""It's okay for people to call us out on things that are actually morally wrong, *if doing so is morally beneficial*"" and they deem calling out on the way we treat animals not beneficial since it produces adverse effects (for example, people eating meat out of spite, or whatever).  
  
  
Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your end goal of giving this view you posit a 'fair shake', but if it is to find  an argument in favor of not judging historical figures, then it won't be found here. 
  

Earlier, you said:  
 &gt; That's fine, but notice that you're a minority opinion on this one.    

I doubt the majority hold that we shouldn't call out on those who act wrongly; instead that 'it's not okay to judge people from the past (even if they acted morally wrong), because they didn't know any better'. So perhaps the majority position would be something along the lines of:   
1. It's okay to judge on someone for doing something they know to be morally wrong.    
2. People from the past who acted morally wrong because of their historical context didn't know they acted morally wrong.    
3. Therefore, we shouldn't judge people from the past who acted wrongly because they didn't know any better.

It struck me on a replay of Episode 5, when Jefferson said that Max had seemed more confident during that week than she probably had in her entire life, what a big problem with the story was. Over and over through the episodes, people comment on how intense she's becoming, about how she's finally taking charge. It seems like positive character growth that's building to something, but in the end we're told that this wasn't actually a good thing. She should have done nothing, and everything would've gone better. She shouldn't have changed at all because that wasn't what fate wanted from her.

Really odd message to have, in my opinion","1446336734"

So as a Titanfall example theres a Satchel chrage which is a huge aoe and basicly instant free kill, theres the shotgun thats instant 1 tap at close to medium range then finally the smart pistol that just takes 1 second of barely any aim to lock on and aim bot you down.

 He's had a real mixed bag of results and early on, before he shed a lot of his mass, he got gassed far too easily.  Same thing with people like Bob Sapp and Brock Lesnar.  Physically imposing but with a limited skill set.  Even so, Brock managed to win the UFC title and defend it and even Bob Sapp managed to beat Ernesto Hoost (one of the most well regarded kickboxers ever)...twice.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt; The evidence I put to you is that it there are enough people out there saying it is true.

That doesn't convince me. There are literally billions of people who believe things that are easily demonstrated to be false. I was curious if there was any plausible evidence for the statement you made and, it sounds like not. 

&gt; The article op posted was about a team who have reversed their position on a subject.
&gt; Laudable.
&gt; But that means that at one point they felt that they had satisfactorily answered the question.

That's how science works. In science, you never prove anything with certainty. You gather evidence that lets you answer very specific questions with a specific level of certainty. The less uncertainty, the harder you have to work to gather the evidence (and more you have to spend generally). They answered it with a relatively low level of certainty but, they were surprised by the result because they couldn't think of a plausible way that it fitted into accepted theories that have been tested by more evidence so, they gathered more evidence and found that, by chance, as they knew was a possibility, they were wrong the first time. Of course, they can still be wrong, it is just less likely than before. 

This is biology/medicine so, even their second result doesn't really give much certainty (collecting evidence is biology/medicine is quite hard so, compared to, say, physics, the levels of certainty are low) but, as it stands, based on objectively collected scientific evidence, at least according to these people, there is no evidence to suggest that there is a discernible affect of gluten on people who aren't celiacs i.e. as far as they have shown, people who don't have celiac disease who think they are intolerant to gluten are probably just wrong. That doesn't rule out the existence of gluten allergy (an impossibility), just shows that, for some given level of certainty, less than some proportion of people who think they have it are correct. 

I haven't read enough of the literature to be sure if there is evidence that the article doesn't mention that contradicts what these scientists say (experiments are complicated and you should always look for independent verification by different methods if possible and, people are always fallible). 

&gt; To draw the line and say we know everything now is just as silly.

I agree, which is why I am not saying that. 

&gt; my question is: what kind of standards of evidence are you expecting, because you'll probably never get that kind of quality in food science.

It doesn't have to reach the standards these people went to but, some evidence that is plausible. People are so often wrong about how things affect them individually (placebo and nocebo effect) that their own anecdotal evidence isn't very useful. It is wrong more often than it is right. A double blind study is enough to start. More than one study with different methods is enough to start to think about whether to believe something. ","1446336741"
"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","All in all, an alright episode, but not much more.

Capaldi is great as usual and EvilClara was certainly fun, and I *love* Kate, but it felt all over the place. I'd have kept more of the characters together or kept some of them in fewer locations. 

The Clara switcheroo was pretty much obvious from the get go, but I'm guessing that might have been on purpose - they might just do us one better next week by revealing that a lot of those we assumed were humans were actually other, non-rebel Zygons. The New Mexico policewoman's monologue in the end certainly seems to refer to an internal Zygon conflict rather than a human/Zygon one.

Calling it now: Kate Lethbridge-Stewart overpowered officer Norlander, but may not be a human to begin with. The same goes for the soldiers and the commander in Fakenameistan, as the Doctor wonders as to the reason for the church Zygons' disappearance.","1446336741"

What will happen if we somehow manage to bring in more players, and thereby money for Cyanide is the following:

Cyanide sees the money coming in.

Cyanide thinks the game is a success.

Cyanide sees no reason to make the game better.

Cyanide gets the chance to make Blood Bowl 3.

Cyanide screws up BB3 even more than BB2.

Blood Bowl fans get even more angry with Cyanide.

Those people brought in under the promise they'll get a great game that'll get even better over time, are angry at their (now former) friends.

Instead, i say if Cyanide doesn't get their stuff together and make Blood Bowl 2 an actually good Blood Bowl game, let them sink. There are other developers out there who could do a much much better job.
Paradox seems to be on a buying spree. 
Sure it would mean lots of DLC, but hey it's not like that won't happen with Cyanide. If we're lucky that is. If we're unlucky they give us 2-3 races as DLC, and then stop caring because the DLC doesn't sell enough.","1446336747"

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","The part about being calm all of the time ties into what I've been thinking about proper flow and feedback in our interaction with the world. Flow is what I call when interaction (for example human interaction) is optimal, where it becomes a dance, the ideal give and take. Feedback is what must occur to achieve this flow where all parties involved in the interaction give feedback regarding their part in it. This occurs subtly and directly through body language, tone of voice, word choice and direct speech. Being agreeable at all times throws a monkey wrench into the situation because proper feedback is disrupted (because you're scared to show displeasure) thereby destroying the interaction, the flow. 

This is what happens when we come home after a busy day to complain about all the shitty people we encountered, these shitty people that we likely smiled through our teeth at while hiding our irritation. This causes bottled-up emotions which leads to feeling like the world is against you, feeling like everyone can walk all over you and you are powerless to stop them. 

I realized that to be truly calm and in control, we have to get angry when it calls for being angry. Simply ignoring the unsavory dynamics of life won't make them go away in mind and memory because I still remember those times I stayed quiet when I was being mistreated or misrepresented. I will often fantasize about reacting differently and this just depresses me more because I can't live in the present. But those times when I reacted properly, I got angry and I showed my displeasure to the world, they don't bother me and in fact I feel they are achievements in my ability to control the situation.  

So we definitely have to interact properly with the world and that doesn't mean always being happily stoic, because that is simply the pragmatic safe route for those who are overcome by fear. Like in the movie Network, say ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!""","1446336749"

"modelparliament","t5_37tbm","**THIS WEEK: AN AUSTRALIAN REPUBLIC**

This week’s ReddiPoll asks you about an Australian Republic.

There are many models for a Republic: those that retain the flavour of Australia’s Parliament versus those that are more like other countries. Even if our Parliamentary system stays the same, there are many models of how the Head of State would be chosen and what their powers would be. To choose the Head of State, models could include: direct election of any person, selection from a list of eminent people, appointment by the parliament, appointment by the PM, etc. Models also differ on whether the Head of State would be a minimal Head of State (e.g. if the ‘Queen’ was elected), a Governor-General, or a President (e.g. combine Queen &amp; Governor-General, etc).

To cover all of the possibilities, ReddiPoll offers the following broad options for you to indicate your preference:

Survey Response | Further Information
-|-
McGarvie model: Governor-General recommended by PM | [Wikipedia: McGarvie Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGarvie_Model)
Presidential model: appointed by Prime Minister | Example: [Australian Republican Movement (PDF)](https://web.archive.org/web/20030626145109/http://www.republic.org.au/6models/6models.pdf)
Presidential model: appointed by an elected group | Example: [Wikipedia: Bi-partisan appointment model, 1999 referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-partisan_appointment_republican_model)
Presidential model: directly elected for political powers | Example: USA
Presidential model: directly elected for ceremonial powers | Example: Ireland
Other model: Minimal | Example: [Wikipedia: Copernican paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_paradigm_(Australia\))
Other model: Non-minimal | Example: Overhaul system of Government

A nice high end restaurant where you're going to pay $40 a steak + extra for sides, drinks, etc for a dinner for two will cost you let's say $250. 15% tip would be $37.50  

If you had 3 tables at a time, you will make at least $100 in about 2  1/2 hours on the average, maybe even more. A restaurant won't pay you $35 an hour wage to serve tables, it just won't happen.

Even if you're stiffed a few times a night, you will still come out on top way more than a wage. A restaurant won't be able to operate paying servers $30 an hour.

If you didn't drink that much, stop drinking entirely. 

Now, did you corroborate the story with anyone else? Sometimes coworkers have agendas that might result in a lie being told like this.

If you are certain you did this, then you have apologized and assured him there was nothing to it. In fact you don't even remember it. You're really just repeating what was told to you. You assume you did but have no recollection of it. And that has alerted you that you cannot drink like that ever again and you will not.

I understand your point, I do, however you are associating the actions of the Mexican government with that of the Mexican people. Like in any nation, people will disagree on many subjects, in Mexico immigration is definitely one. There are people who do not want other Latinos coming into Mexico, and there are others who do not mind. Latinos as a whole are grouped together when here in the US, but the reality is much more complex in Latin America. There is strong racism between nations, especially with salvadoran people and Mexican people. Here in the US, you are taught that all illegals are Mexican because they are Hispanic but that is far from the truth. There are a ton of people from Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, etc. All these people come to the US for a chance of a better life, most do at a young age, not knowing better, and build a life here and don't know anything else. I'm going off on a tangent to educate you a little, but the immigration laws in Mexico are from the government, yes, but that's not necessarily the will of the people, just like here in the US.

I really don't think rape happens as much as you think it does. I've had plenty of girls, married or with boyfriends, bring alcohol over to my place after I've texted them about exactly what I'm going to do to them. Alcohol is just an excuse they tell their boyfriends to blame shift. I don't believe that crap. If a girl drinks that's on her. I have never seen anybody actually rape a girl.  Just regret getting caught and blame shift like crazy.

I'll never get married again now that I know how the laws work and have seen first hand how instantly the girl is no longer attracted to you.  But I'm in an ltr right now. How long is it going to last?  Who knows?

After being given more time to develop and consider the idea, I don't mind adding the maps further down the line, again, after new players/teams have been given a lot of time to develop. So yes, that's a good point that by the time they are added, we'll be a few more months into player development. I think the eSport scene should hold off another month or two after their in-game implementation just to give all players and teams time to adjust, but once players feel comfortable playing on these maps, I see no reason why they couldn't be incorporated.","1446336762"

Information: I am an intermediate-advanced skier who likes to hit the main mountain, go off trail, and hit big jumps. I was looking for a ski that would fit that criteria all-around, and the Blizzard Regulator seemed like a good fit. I didn't do that much research on the bindings but the Tyrolia Attack seemed like a fit for what I am going to throw at it. If anyone has some other skis/bindings that they think would fit please let me know. I am buying boots at a local shop, I am trying to do this online because there seems to be a lot more variety online then at a shop.

Budget: skis&lt;$500, Bindings: &lt;$200

Also if any wants to know I am 5'11 (180 cm), and weigh 181 lbs.

"CruciblePlaybook","t5_37lup","No Backup Plans: Only useful on Defenders who run shotguns. Defender is a very underused subclass, especially considering that you could be using a Sunbreaker, and the map this week isn't favorable to shotguns.

Immolation Fists: It *could be* useful when enemies bunch up, but its one of those exotics that **could be** isn't as good as **will be**. Why waste an exotic slot on allowing you to kill 2 enemies close together when you can probably just throw a second Hammer?


Sealed Ahamkara Grasps: These are definitely very useful, but a good question to ask is does having a second smoke bomb outweigh the need to use Graviton Forfeit (Probably not, Shadestep is amazing for Nightstalker's neutral game) or Alpha Lupi. If you aren't a Nightstalker, these have even less utility, meaning that you might as well use Alpha Lupi.


Skull of Dire Ahamkara: Not exactly bad, seeing as the main perk allows you to survive a Hammer of Sol to Nova Bomb a Sunbreaker, although that is niche and only useful the one or *maybe* two times you have/use a Nova Bomb. The other part of the perk improves Energy Drain, which correlates to more grenades. But if you're that interested in using grenades, Voidfang is probably a better option for that.


Voidfang Vestments: Possibly the only passable one, but is also one of the things he mentioned originally:

&gt; Nemisis is the only option really, void fang for those who need...


Now ask yourself how many of these were used because they didn't have one of the Alpha Lupi/Nemesis, or was their highest Light armor? Good chance are that many people used the exotics they did simply because they were looking for higher Light or didn't have one of the fast revive armors.","1446336764"

If Stannis became King and Rob still claimed ""King of North"", Stannis would have considered it an act of rebellion and try to quash it. For heck stack, he wouldn't even compromise with his brother.

However fast over the limit you go *entirely* depends on the road. I have a back-street road near my house which is a 50km/h speed limit (30Mph) but it's as wide-open as a highway. It's only a two lane road, but it's wider than 5 or 6 lanes (2 lanes of parked cars, 2 lanes of driving each way, but those lanes could fit four cars through). Everyone travels that road at 60-100 (40 - 60mph) but how fast they actually go I guess depends on what kind of person they are.

There's no way I'm obstructing the flow of traffic to follow that limit in that scenario. I'll just get tailgated. Have you ever tried to drive intentionally slower than traffic on something that looks like a highway? It's torture, not because you wanna go fast or something, but because you feel like you're doing something wrong. And it probably is wrong to drive too slowly.","1446336773"

I'm 27. I graduated with about $50k in debt. Throughout school I worked full time which I used to help pay for some of it, but between a shitty apartment food every week, Internet, it didn't shave a lot off.

After I graduated I was essentially unemployed for 3 years. I say essentially because I worked for a lot of it, but it was never on the books or with benefits or anything and usually only lasted a few weeks at best. I wanted to send out a minimum of 5 applications a day but I soon realized how unrealistic that was. The number of jobs I had the skills to actually do and were available in my area were few and far between. I didn't have the money to move. But I still applied to every job I was qualified for and a lot I wasn't or was over qualified for.

My mother who I live with and still do found herself unemployed several times during this period. So the money I was making, little though it was, went to buying food or paying rent. I still had my own expenses too. Gas, oil, car insurance, phone, parking ramps from interviews. Sometimes to make rent I had to take out cash advances on my credit card. For every step forward I took, it was two steps back. I had already pawned everything of value I had, including my grandfathers wedding ring, which I can't find the words to describe how demoralizing that was and still is.

Finally after 3 years though I landed a job. All that time my loans had been in deferment, gathering interest being added to the principle. Along with my credit card debt, my total debt was up to $65k. My job only pays $32k/year, but after the deductions from benefits and everything, my take home is only a little over $20k/year. 

The minimum payment on my school loans each month takes over 1/2 of what I made for the month. I'd like to pay more than the minimum but I just can't afford it. I still have the other credit card payments and other expenses that take up the rest of my earnings. I recently put my loans back into deferment to prioritize paying off the cash advances, because of their higher interest, but that's still about 7 months away from being paid off (whole card, not just cash adv.). Then I can get back to my student loans.

I don't go out at night or on the weekends. I know I can't afford it. My friends have stopped calling ever since I was unemployed because they knew what my answer would be. You could find ways I could have saved more here and there, I was never perfect, and sometimes trying to save money just cost me more in the end, but ultimately you'd be talking about the difference of a couple thousand, not a significant percentage and it wouldn't change my future.

I figure, with the kind of raises I can expect from working hard, working against the interest on my loans, when I'm about 40 years old, I'll have the privilege of calling myself broke and penniless... but finally debt free. No house, no assets, no savings, still living in a tiny apartment with my mom.

And that's the most depressing part about this whole thing to me. I have no future. Who the fuck wants to date someone who's 40 and still living at home with no money to their name? Hell, even at 30 that's a tough sell. I can hope for a miracle woman, who just happens to be single too, and doesn't mind that I'm penniless and still living with my mom but I know the reality of my situation. I wish I could have fallen in love one day and gotten married, but if I fall in love now it'll only leave me heartbroken and feeling like a failure. I wish I could have been a dad one day, but I just don't see that panning out realistically. At least not ethically where I could actually provide my kids with more than an empty stomach and frostbitten fingers. 

When you listen to people talk who are in their twilight years, it's about the importance of family, and what an important part of life it is. It's a part that I won't be able to take part in. And that's where I start loosing my sense of purpose for this world. Even with paying off my debt at 40, it'll take me time to save up for a down payment on a house. 35 year mortgage? Even if I did it when I'm 40, I'd be paying for that house till I'm 75 and no company in America would keep me around till I'm that old, at least not in an earning capacity to pay a mortgage. 

I know there are a lot of wonderful places around the world I'd love to see, but I don't think I'll get to see any of them. I know there are some amazing foods, that I don't think I'll get to taste. I know there are some incredible women out there, worth meeting, spending time with, and developing a connection with, but I doubt I'll even meet any of them when I'm staying home every night, not spending money I don't have. I'd have liked to raise kids of my own, but it's just unrealistic with my debt and my earning potential.

When I think about everything in aggregate, about how totally fucked I am, I think about the cost of a gun. My payments are only due once a month. In the interim I could use the money I'd spend on my loans and buy a gun. I know people say it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem but really it seems like a permanent problem. Mathematically and statically, I can see what the sum total of my life has in store for me and I don't think it's worth it.

You can point to various parts of my life where mistakes were made that led me here. Choosing Microbiology as a degree instead of something in a field that pays better like engineering or computer science or finance. Choosing to pursue that as a career choice because I had skills in it, instead of a sales job, which I tried to do but HR usually sited my education and college work experience not matching up. 

I'm not a drug addict, I don't take vacations, I don't date or go out to the bar. I chose a pretty regular path of going to college, earning a degree and working in that field. I realize this was a long rant but, I hope in the end I've convinced you, it's not simply ""just manage your money better"". The only real spending I have left to cut, is the seconds of my life, and honestly, it's an appealing option. Everything in this world that's worth experiencing, costs money, and it's worth experiencing with loved ones. I wish i could have experienced some of that. Be grateful for the life you have, and the debt you don't.","1446336775"

"Veterans","t5_2rc75","Leaving a job off your resume isn't lying. You're not required by law to put every single thing you've done in your life on a CV. In fact, you should not. The resume should be tailored specifically for the job you are applying for. 

As an example, I keep a single resume with *all* of my stuff, and it is a good four pages long and only gets longer. It's basically a rolling history of my work and all accomplishments. When I make a specific resume for a job I will select the parts that are relevant for the position to highlight my skills and experience that make me a strong candidate. Potential employers don't want to read through a bunch of irrelevant information. My final resume is less than 1 page long. 

They're welcome to do a background check on me, and not mentioning I served or held a position as a dishwasher in high school is not a problem. Now, if I had been arrested and convicted of some felony, and they ask: ""have you ever been convicted..""

The only apology i wanted was the one where you started this little charade so I'm assuming that's what it was for right? An apology for starting this? And why didn't you clear up your apology more on the other post where you said I haven't apologized for my bad behavior and then bring it up now in your recent comment? I don't understand you. It's like you want to keep this going, I'm only replying to you to tell you your own faults that you yourself don't seem to understand, Also I never insulted you, Calling something a hentai ship isn't an insult it's HEY Guess What an Opinion, You on the other hand have been insulting me calling me immature and whatnot.

What you will find is that there is a correlation with weight gain in diets composed of simple carbs. This is because those diets cause people to overeat because they are not satiated for long since those calories digest very quickly. Again, calories are a measure of energy and it does not matter if you get them from sugar or lean meat as far as weight gain and loss goes. It will be hard to control consumption when you try to get your calories from sugars but don't try to invalidate something like thermodynamics without having actual evidence.

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","&gt;I don't think a very strong argument can be made for different insurance rates based on usage time.

Usage time is at the core of risk. The more time you're on the road the greater your chance of an accident simply by virtue of being exposed to more traffic.

&gt;I mentioned in my other post that there are other occupations where people drive hundreds of more hours than an average urban worker but face no difference in insurance. My example was a vet who would drive all over a province to visit different farms. 

Sure there are outliers, but the rates are based on average drivers. Many insurers offer reduced rates for low-mileage drivers.

&gt;I hurdle I do see is the liability for passengers in the case of an accident. That is something that could definitely be used to leverage different insurance rates.

Sure, that's another factor. Insurance policies are generally specifically written to exclude paying passengers (though they tend to allow the recovery of expenses for things like car pools).","1446336784"

His refutation of Job is more rhetorical than substantive.  Of course Job had the ""right"" (what a modern catch-word that is!) to ask, as did Christ (Matt. 27:46, Mk. 16:34).  God also had the right to ask some things of His own (Job 38).  The thing is, though, that it doesn't much matter whether God has the ""right""; He *is* the Right.  One might complain that His actions seem arbitrary, but to what higher authority will such a plaintiff appeal?  The only answer I've heard: to his own judgment.  Best of luck with that.","1446336790"

"CitiesSkylines","t5_331rj","I actually followed the life of one of the cims in my city via the My Favourite Cims mod. Using the mod I had discovered there was a five year old named Mary Smith in a cell at a local police station (I posted a screenshot of it about a month ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/3nf0me/damn_harsher_prison_sentences_really_are_harsh/)). Anyway, I ""favourited"" her with the mod so I could keep looking in on her until she died.

She ended up being transferred to a prison from the police station until she was 10 years old. After that she was arrested 2 more times (that I saw) followed by shorter stints in the pokey - I think the first time was the longest because she was picked up in a district that had a ""harsher prison sentences"" policy. During her second prison sentence, she must have earned her GED as she went in ""uneducated"" and came out ""well educated"". Before the third arrest she had gotten married as her last name changed to Scott (but I knew it was still her 'cause I had her favourited by the mod) and she got a job working at the university, where she was later arrested. While waiting for transfer on the third arrest she must have given birth since she was 31 when arrested and the next time I checked in on her, she had a 13 year old daughter and was 43 years old herself. She ended up having a menopause baby (a boy) when she was 46, but her daughter was mysteriously gone by then. I have no idea what happened to her daughter 'cause the mod will normally still display any cims favourited even if they've moved or died, they're just greyed out and it says they've either left town or are living ""six feet under"". Part of me remains a little suspicious of Mary, even though her brushes with the law seemed to be done with. She continued along peacefully until passing of old age at 98 years, a year after her husband.

I took screenshots of all of this and was going to post a little story about the ""life and crimes of Mary Smith"" but life got in the way and I got distracted. I still think it's kinda amazing how much of an actual life the little cims in our cities have beyond just moving from point A to point B.","1446336791"

I must give credit to Eve; she was very encouraging to work with. She helped with proof reading and creative guidance. I also appreciated Eve performing this story as she has a strong sex-is-good-not-evil philosophy. The story was meant for Halloween, so it needed some horror to make it work.

*Economic efficiency...ahh, now we are into imaginary efficiency.*

You don't seem to understand that economic efficiency does, in fact, exist, and that it can (often does) lead to choices and actions which superficial analysis concludes is inefficient under some other definition of efficiency.

You have in fact been arguing that buying locally is more *efficient* (your definition) because it doesn't involve *unnecessary* (your interpretation) transportation or marketing. I'm responding that your interpretation ignores consumer choice and information.

I'm ***not*** putting words into your mouth, just highlighting the absurdity of the implications of your statements.

But, yes, I reject your contention that Australia sending ore to China, China processing ore into metal and sending metal to Europe, Europe using that metal to manufacture cars and sending those cars to Australia is wasteful. What would be wasteful would be forcing everyone on the planet to buy only goods end-to-end produced within 200km of where they live or, much worse, make every manufacturer set up manufacturing facilities in every locality.

Read a history of trade. Read a history of the Silk Road. Throughout history trade has been a surer route to wealth than local resource abundance.

You have a long way to go but you have the monsters to work with, so it's just a matter of time :p.

Obviously your main focus is getting a giants team, dragons will follow, and necro is a far priority, since the runes you get there are not really that needed at your current progression, and as you get better runes your ToA progression will increase naturally too.","1446336793"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Christians were raping and beheading Muslims in the former Yugoslavia [just 20 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre#Massacre). 

&gt;Many women and girls suffered rape and sexual abuse and other forms of torture. According to the testimony of Zumra Šehomerovic:

&gt;**The Serbs began at a certain point to take girls and young women out of the group of refugees. They were raped. The rapes often took place under the eyes of others and sometimes even under the eyes of the children of the mother.** A Dutch soldier stood by and he simply looked around with a Walkman on his head. He did not react at all to what was happening. It did not happen just before my eyes, for I saw that personally, but also before the eyes of us all. The Dutch soldiers walked around everywhere. It is impossible that they did not see it.

&gt;**There was a woman with a small baby a few months old. A Chetnik told the mother that the child must stop crying. When the child did not stop crying, he snatched the child away and cut its throat. Then he laughed.** There was a Dutch soldier there who was watching. He did not react at all.

&gt;I saw yet more frightful things. **For example, there was a girl, she must have been about nine years old. At a certain moment some Chetniks recommended to her brother that he rape the girl. He did not do it and I also think that he could not have done it for he was still just a child. Then they murdered that young boy.**I have personally seen all that. I really want to emphasize that all this happened in the immediate vicinity of the base. In the same way I also saw other people who were murdered. Some of them had their throats cut. Others were beheaded.","1446336794"

Setting apart the larger differences, I'd say it comes down to a difference between how to access functions and values.

Consider this:

    (sort (list 5 1 3 2 4) &gt;)

compared to this:

    (sort (list 5 1 3 2 4) #'&gt;)

This has some broader implications, and there arguments about which form is ""better"".

"AskPhotography","t5_2t96o","Autofocus has a much harder time in darkness and, depending on how you have your camera configured, it may try to refocus with every shot.  I know it's tricky with that tiny viewfinder get it right, but I still recommend manual focus for this kind of photography.  Having a laptop or tablet you can connect to your Nikon will give you immediate feedback if you're unsure if it's in focus.


Preserve your night vision by using a red flashlight.


You will start seeing star trails as you creep past 15 second exposures.  Stay under 20 second exposures if this is what you want.  Star trails are present but faint at 20 seconds.  If you want to go the opposite direction,  30 seconds and up creates some really striking trails.


Google Sky Map and Sun Surveyor apps are quite helpful.  And free.



Fortunately, you chose a great camera for night photography.  The DXX00 series performs very well in low light and high ISO, which I rarely have to use.  When you have a little money to invest, I'd recommend getting a lens capable of f/1.8.  My 35mm f/1.8 is my best friend.

Taken with my Nikon D7100: 20 second exposure, f/1.8, ISO 400.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Indeed, because I have no wikipedia entry!

From a campaign finance reform perspective, there is a huge roadblock in the form of SCOTUS.  The Roberts Court simply will not allow any real campaign finance reform to go through because of the First Amendment implications.  I understand why the Court ruled the way it did in *Citizens United* and *McCutcheon* but I also realize that free speech can be dangerous, especially when monopolized (ie, tons and tons and tons of ads) and when it's heavily spun (ie, most all political ads).  The human problem really messes with things and nothing short of a change in SCOTUS Justices or a Constitutional Amendment will fix that.  Anything else from an actual campaign finance perspective is pretty much a waste of time and money.  

But all is not lost, especially with technology as it is.  We can definitely do more to track influence before/during/after campaigns to stem the perception/reality of corruption in politics.  Much more.  So much that we could even give the American people the opportunity to weigh in, down to the Congressional district.  Imagine bills, summaries, and votes accessible on all smartphones in a Govtrack-like fashion together with the ability to allow constituents to express their support/dislike for said bills.  Now the vast majority of legislation would have no activity on them because we, the people, don't want or care to read everything Congress does.  But what if CISA or SOPA or some other law was being heavily debated and fought for.  Imagine if constituents could go yay or nay on a piece of legislation.  Then imagine if we could go to Representative X and say ""87% of your constituents support this measure after saying they read the bill's text, yet you voted against it... why?""  Imagine that and imagine we can then track all monetary gifts (cash/goods/services) given to all government officials above a certain rank.  Big data could do a lot for curbing problems.  It's the classic ""who watches the Watchmen?"" scenario, with the answer being ""we, the people.""  

Now this is also not easy and Congress won't go for it.  They don't like being held accountable.  But the bully pulpit can be quite strong as we saw with PIPA/SOPA and even the TPP backlash years after the tech community started complaining about it.  The potential is there to curb the problems without significantly altering the system.  

Just spitballing some ideas.  Plus as an added bonus, it pushes government and Americans into the 21st century with technology.  That's always a plus!","1446336804"

We found that their UI was lacking in features and was very unintuitive at the time. I suspect that has changed considering how the rest of their Unifi line is getting better and better. 

The real issues we had:

--Power. The 48v Unifi switches weren't compliant with 802.3af at first, and then seemed to have issues providing power to PoE AP's and phones. 

--VLAN tagging. We had ports that would randomly revert to VLAN 1 or conveniently forget they were a trunk, which caused more than one outage. Bizarre issues.

--DHCP. If you use it for this, we had devices successfully get an address on boot, but then as soon as renewal time came up the switch would ignore the traffic. After half a dozen or so failures, it would ignore DHCP requests for new devices on the network as well. This was mitigated by moving DHCP services to a real server ;)

Off the top of my head, that's all I remember. As I said though, it's been at least a year, so maybe it's fixed? Cisco SG300's quickly replaced them and since we're a Cisco shop at my current job, it was worth it just so it was consistent. ","1446336807"

Never ever design a multiplayer map that is objective based and make it almost entirely linear.

If you have to go through enemy lines and travel a much farther distance to just get a small advantage on capturing the middle point, there is no way you will ever win assuming both teams are equally skilled.

There's a reason why a lot of capture point or objective based games make their middle/odd point not linear in level flow, or make it so its very open / easy to assault. In the snow map, they literally made it the most defensible position in the entire map that allows whoever controls it complete control over all NPC spawns and the map.","1446336809"

That is *not* my opinion, and I think a lot of people who do NaNo have no idea what to write about and that shouldn't stop them! 

OP, If you can't think of something new, write about something old! Take something you know about and throw a twist at it. King Arthur's story in modern day New York City. A kid finds Douglas Adam's infinite improbability machine and it takes him on ridiculous adventures across the galaxy. Peter Pan decides to come home and grow up. 

Or you can just go to a coffee shop and watch people -- write them a backstory, and stick them in a crazy setting like space, Paris, or a magical forest. 

There isn't a reason not to write. The end result might not be great, it might not even be good, but you're writing ability will have grown and you will have written more than you would have otherwise. You can even look up writing prompts and use them to start your story.

"chemhelp","t5_2s6e6","You're thinking of resonance forms. One poster mentioned benzene and that comes up in the topic, but not because benzene is unstable but rather due to it being so stable - one of these unstable groups when attached to it is made stable. This is due to the large number of resonance forms that the molecule can take.

An example is nitrobenzene. Nitro compounds are generally unstable, but due to a delocalized system (you may be thinking of that too) as this electron bounces between the 2 oxygen atoms. These multiple resonance forms are what stabilise it.

Another example would be phenol - an -OH group attached to a benzene ring. Normally, deprotonating an alcohol is not done due to the resulting molecule not being stable as the charge can't be accomodated easily. On a phenol however this charge can be passed around the ring, forming a variety of resonance forms and phenols are quite acidic and lose a proton to go to that charged state, and then pass the charge around the ring.

Delocalisation of electrons stablises systems - like benzene, like nitro groups, carboxylates etc","1446336816"

"Seahawks","t5_2ryle","&gt;precursor to shopping him around before the deadline.

I highly doubt this. Not only for all the reasons you can imagine but It would be shopping him at a low point in his career, he didn't prove all that much his rookie year, he destroys his knee and what...we shop him after having just come back from a destroyed knee? 

&gt;Who does Richardson replace at this point though? 

In what sense? On the roster we would most likely cut RB Brown to make room for Paul. If you mean what WR does he replace? No one permanently, it would have been BJ Daniels but BJ was already cut (is on the PS) to make room for RB Brown. Who's snaps at WR will Paul's cut into? Probably Matthews, Lockette, and Kearse. Just a smidge, enough to get some snaps. 

Overall I have heard no talk of Paul being a trade option, It isn't fully clear on who he will take snaps from but I doubt it will be from Baldwin or Lockett. But when we go empty backfield 5-6 WR sets I bet he will be out there...when we are planning on a deep ball I imagine he will sometimes be out there. 

The good thing about Paul is say he gets scraps in terms of snaps at WR, he gets out there, gets a catch here and there. That isn't so bad, because the odds all of our WR's stay healthy and active the next 8 weeks aren't great. Kearse could go down with a sprained ankle and then who steps in? No not Bryan Walters...its Paul Richardson. This is every more important in the playoffs. He is insanely talented depth right now. 

The overall question of where does he start in say 2016 is an interesting question ever since we drafted Lockett and he turned out to be such a great WR. Trade wise it is a good thing we traded away Norwood, I really see no spot for him on this roster. ","1446336818"

"dogecoin","t5_2zcp2","I don't think people should be dicks (heh) and downvote you for asking an honest question. My opinion is that broadly there are two groups of subscribers here, described below:

The first is people like myself who have been around the earlier days of Bitcoin but do not subscribe to the 'death to the bankers, we will revolutionise finance!!' newsletter frequently pushed by the Bitcoin community. /r/buttcoin is not quite the alternative community because it's too trolly and can be a bit depressing to hang around there too much. One way or another, we found our way here and realized that hey, this is a chillax community with like-minded people who like the idea of crypto-currency but also think it can (and ought to) exist side-by-side and supplementing the more 'traditional' financial system we have now. From the posts, I've seen that there are some serious developer talents hanging around here. We've got people with experience building scalable systems, PhDs and researchers etc. So it's not all jokers and dogetards who read this sub.

The second group is basically the demography of Reddit: young, white, middle-class American males who got tipped dogecoin somewhere or wanted to find out more about Bitcoin but got intimidated by the perceived 'complexity' of Bitcoin. Again, here dogecoin serves as a n00b-friendly intro to the Crypto world. Most people eventually graduate to the bigger world of Bitcoin once they're tired of collecting penny-shavings from dogrcoin faucets, it's a bit like your first sex.

"podemos","t5_31h78","Lamentablemente no puedo estar de acuerdo contigo, aunque me gustaría.

Hipócritas, egoístas, codiciosos, envidiosos, lameculos, psicópatas, mentirosos, manipuladores, ladrones, asesinos, especuladores, violentos, conformistas, abusadores, reaccionarios, corruptos y corruptores, estafadores, prevaricadores, evasores fiscales, proxenetas, mafiosos, violadores,...es lo que traen 80 años de dominación fascista en el país.

Pero no pienses mal, mantengo la esperanza de que las cosas pueden cambiar para mejor. Entre otras cosas me ayuda mucho la Plaza, donde se pueden palpar las ganas de cambio que tiene nuestra sociedad. Pero me doy cuenta de que es más una triste ilusión que una realidad. El reloj del tiempo avanza inexorable y a mayor velocidad que el cambio urgente que necesitamos. De hecho, a la misma velocidad que aumentan la desigualdad y la pobreza. Directamente proporcional al aumento de unas pocas fortunas.

¡Cómo me gustaría darte la razón¡. Pero cuando miro a mi pequeño, se me parte el alma al ver el mundo que dejamos a las próximas generaciones. Un mundo que les empujará a convertirse en alguno de los perfiles que he enumerado. Y es que, como decía Ortega: **""yo soy yo y mi circunstancia""**, y es que es así, ""la vida es una serie de colisiones con el futuro"".

A mis casi 45 años son muy escasas las personas que he encontrado a los que pueda definir como honrados, honestos, valientes, sinceros, generosos...resumiendo: no son los valores que definen a la mayoría (no están ""de moda"").

Es la cultura del ""porque yo lo valgo"", y a ver quién es el lumbreras que les convence de lo contrario. Somos incapaces de trascender como especie, seguimos siendo individualidades egoístas con un final anunciado: la autodestrucción. Y es que, como aprendí hace ya muchos años: **""la vida es maravillosa, pero el mundo es una mierda""**.

Lo lamento, me gustaría ser más positivo, pero no encuentro motivos. Ojalá esté equivocado. Nada me hará más feliz que reconocerlo.

Salud y República

Pd.: Por cierto, y para que quede claro: mi mayor preocupación NO es conseguir un trabajo, sino tener un futuro mejor (y así me va...). Es decir, no me conformo con los medios, quiero el fin en sí mismo.","1446336819"

The link you gave only refers to that as the ""typical situation"" where you are already suing for damages. Employees who quit their jobs cannot generally be sued for damages. Contractors who are hired for specific jobs can reasonably be sued, such as the house, or programmers who are hired for specific projects, or athletes.  Furthermore, the justification for not allowing specific performance in the employment context is the thirteenth amendment. It is not slavery if it is a deal you agree to, but it does violate that amendment if they don't let you quit. Damages and non-competes are not involuntary servitude, forcing you to work at a place would be, soldiers are interesting though, I don't know the answer to that one, I assume there is caselaw on the matter.

Edit: I checked, and there is caselaw on the matter, the Supreme Court addressed the military and the 13th amendment in a few cases, e.g.,  Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366 (1918); United States v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968).","1446336821"

For example in that article, ""the case for closing women’s prisons is the same as the case for imprisoning fewer men"", but then ""women are also more likely than men to have children who rely on them for support"" which is implicitly patriarchal view.

Edit: they recently changed the rules allowing for flexing starting in week 5, but they're only allowed a total of 2 flexes between weeks 5 and 11. I imagine the only reason why they didn't flex this one is because the limit on primetime games and the expectation that Carolina or Green Bay could be playing for their division in week 16 (Car) or 17 (GB). It also doesn't hurt that the teams they have next week are Philly and Dallas (they won't be hurting for ratings).","1446336827"

Canada won't be seeing android pay or apple pay for another year and a half to two years, so why add in the gimmicky tech now for something the majority of users don't use yet. 

You have to realize that these phones are part of the budget market and I'm sure sales are higher in India and Asia then all of North America. Lau recognizes the potential partnerships and brand building that is possible in India, something which North America can't offer. I can't imagine a carrier offering a oneplus phone in north america ever. But in India and Asia that is a possibility.

Yes, if your reason is valid beyond 'muh private property fuck off.' But tbh I would assume this situation would arise very rarely, for reasons already stated. Like if someone repeatedly mis-uses something, for a destructive purpose or whatever. But people can be taught how to use stuff and also destructive behaviour would likely become very rare in a society without scarcity, hence:

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;It is common knowledge that Americans do very poor in Geography. This is because the emphasis is placed on History and not Geography. We aren't teaching our future generation Geography in school, we're teaching History.

First of all, I'm inclined to say that knowing the specifics of geography of the top of your head really isn't all that important in the grand scheme of things. There are of course things that you absolutely should know, like what and where the very large and historically powerful countries are. Specifically, I think that the countries whose locations you should know are (If you're American, though I think many of these also apply to people elsewhere): the US, Canada, Mexico, maybe Brazil, China, Japan, India, Australia, Russia, France, Britain, and Germany. You should obviously know the continents, and the general locations of important regions like the Middle East. Otherwise, you should have just a general idea of where other states are relative to those markers: Israel, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt, etc... are in or near the Middle East and so on. It really isn't that important for you to know more of the details than that unless your future career path requires you to engage directly with that material. 

Regarding whether history should be prioritized over geography, yes, I think it should be. History is really about how people have related to each other historically, and that inevitable involves studying how land affected the way they related to each other. I'm a Biology person, and I've really never been particularly interested in the social sciences/humanities, but I'm required to take a 2 courses in non-Western history, so I'm taking History of the Modern Middle East, and I have to say that this is definitely the most valuable class that I've taken that hasn't been directly related to my major. It has taught not only taught me more about the geography of the region and how that was important in shaping its history, it has also given me a completely new perspective on what's going on today. I went to a French immersion school, and I go to a very liberal artsy University, and, quite frankly, I've had way to much of my time wasted on language in both high school and College. As far as I'm concerned, I didn't need to be learning grammar after 8th grade (and my teachers agreed with that), and I definitely didn't need to have my time wasted reading Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Victor Hugo, etc... All that I've gleaned from those courses is the ability to say ""Hah! I know who wrote that book/espoused that sort of thinking! Can I have a prize?!"" If I had had every single language class in high school replaced with a history class about some region of the world, I would now be increadibly thankful. My understanding of what is going on in the world today (and of geography, since you seem to care about that) would be enormously enriched.

&gt;Most countries end up being in a bad position globally due to colonization. This is not something that history teaches. History teaches a very pro-Western perspective. I'm pretty neutral on Zionism but let me use your example, which doesn't recount the Jews who originally lived there. Also I doubt 80% of Americans can even point to Israel on a map. It's far easier to teach about the issue surrounding Israel in a course encompassing Current Events or Geography as opposed to encompassing it with a lesson on a particular time period. Also a lot more of the issues with Isreal as it relates to America also pertain to American presence in the middle-east but we don't recount that in History lessons because it's not History. History limits our perspectives to current events to one particular perspective in one particular time period.

This isn't a matter of history being less valuable than other courses, it's a matter of history being taught poorly. The content of history textbooks should be decided by leading historians rather than by politicians. History should teach what colonization has done to the world. If it doesn't, that's not a problem with history, that's a project with the curriculum design. How could you possibly teach about the issues surrounding Israel without teaching history? This is especially true of Israel because the history surrounding it is incredibly recent history -- people who experienced it are still alive today, so I would argue that it is far more important for this to be taught than, say, the history of the Ancient Roman Empire (which I learned about in middle school and high school). How can you argue that American presence in the Middle East isn't history? Of course it's history! It's just modern history. The whole point of history is that it should teach you about past events over time (i.e. across many periods, and not just distant periods) and as objectively as possible (it's history, not opinions on past events). Just because it isn't taught the way it should be doesn't mean that history isn't valuable, it means that the way it is taught should be reformed. What you're proposing is a reform to reduce the volume of history taught, and most of your arguments against history have more to do with poor curriculum design than with an actual problem with History. Why not instead use reform as an opportunity to improve the way that history is taught?

&gt;Without getting into a whole other debate about racism it's my perspective that teaching about slavery and the civil rights movements of the 1960s only serves racism. I think that placing emphasis on the past to try to give understanding to current issues isn't productive. It's more effective to teach it as a part of institutionalized racism in a Sociology class as opposed to lumping it in with the Vietnam War or Civil war. If Education administrators find it necessary to teach about the struggles of the black community it should be done as it's own lesson plan or course, that focuses solely on African American history, recounts sociological causes and effects and backs it up with statistics. That is a far more effective way to allow our children to have understanding to black communities struggles.

How exactly does teaching about the effects of racism and the way it was fought serve racism? Why is teaching about how the events of today were shaped unproductive? I'm the last person who would argue that decisions today should be maybe on the basis of the past state of affairs, but how is understanding the facts behind an issue (which is what would ideally be taught in history courses) unproductive when facing it down?  Why would learning sociological theories about why things happened or are happening be more valuable than teaching people what actually happened, giving students the opportunity to consider the implications themselves? To be fair, I'm not very familiar with sociology, and I've never put much store in the validity of theories in the soft sciences. I view history as similar to hard sciences in that it has be taught as a set of hard facts (or something that approaches facts) rather than as a bunch of maybes. 

&gt;This only proves that history is ineffective at teaching these lessons. This seems like it is an issue that could be studied in far more depth in an economics class. How could this relationship between federally subsidized banks and mortgage loans ever be applicable to high schoolers while learning about the Oregon trail, the Mexican-American war and slavery?

Of course, history isn't enough. People need to understand things like economics (which I, unfortunately, was never taught), government, and maybe even some sociology, but, as far I humanities go, I would put History at the top of the list, maybe even the only one on the list of required classes (I don't really consider grammar, writing, and reading to fall under the ""humanities"" umbrella).","1446336836"

Not just Jurassic Park franchise in general but it pees me off that so many movies seem to portray people (women in particular) who don't have/want kids as cold, emotionally distant, snooty ""business-types"" who just need to realise that their priorities in life are completely wrong and unimportant, and suddenly the idea of having kids is simply magical and rosy.","1446336837"

"linux","t5_2qh1a","at the moment my guess is that the numerical majority of the people who've tried HURD are people who are just trying it out to see what it's like and don't use it regularly.

Among people who really use HURD, most people are developers of HURD, hobbyists, or students. Why? Because it's not really for production yet. But if you are a computer science major, the HURD is a great chance to apply what you are learning or learned and contribute back to a project that needs you! You can make an impact here. HURD is a great kernel to develop file systems on too.

For the vast majority of typical users however, the kernel is really 
irrelevant. All that matters is it it runs well and hopefully the day will come when Linux and HURD will at least reach parity there and the hope is that HURD will even exceed Linux. The ""why"" usually doesn't matter unless you are a hard core CS person.

 Yes, specifically line 79 in dictionary.c is using an uninitialised value in the if statement. My guess is that you don't initialize `root` (or any of the other nodes) after you `malloc` them. `pointer = malloc(...)` is a bit like `int i;`, it allocates memory, but you haven't _set_ that memory to anything so it's a ""garbage"" value (simply whatever was left in memory the last time it was used).

This is documented as self-harm behavior, which eventually culminates in a suicide attempt. A lot of suicidal teens also suffer from compulsive suicidal thoughts-- it's all they can think about, all the time. A very small fraction of my patients suffer from hallucinations, which tell them to harm themselves or others.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","agree, but perhaps understandable...

After watching the whole segment [ including the annoying bells-n-whistles crud of the 'interview special' format, ugh ] .. I come away thinking Remini feels the basic teachings were not so crazy, more it was the harsh and divisive policies of management that caused most of the pain.  Then again most people are okay with most religions - when you take away the crazy you're left with 'treat others as you would like to be treated' ... 'inspect your own thoughts and motivations' etc. perhaps healthy edicts to live by.  Admittedly, in Scientology there is a lot of crazy to go with whatever the core principles are.  

My point is, its a long path from deep-religion-with-crazy to religion-lite-with-less-crazy to agnosticism to admitting there really is no god and its up to us humans to make life on the planet better for each other.  So maybe its natural that members who leave fall back to the 'default' of a more mainstream less extreme religion ?  It means you don't have to question your whole world view, while going thru a massive transition.

I personally was not able to make that big leap to Atheism in one jump after being brought up Catholic.. it was a gradual process until finally one day I thought lets just throw out all this crap that were not sure is true, and stick to the basics - science for what is measurable, and being a basically good, kind and accepting person for other things in life.

Maybe the difference between a cult and a religion is just the way they treat people who leave?  In their defense Scientologists aren't beheading apostates, they are not ISIS.. but their tactics are pretty brutal towards families who leave, and those who investigate them.  If this was moderated, would Scientology be any worse than mainstream religions ?  They must realize the cat is out of the bag, and they will have to adapt and be much less aggressive to people who leave, or lose their membership numbers.  Maybe they are so wealthy they don't care at this point... time will tell.

Basically the rider can file an urgeant appeal to the CAS if he reckons that the sanction is directly affecting his championship or career (instead of just punishing a rule infringement). In that case, the punishment will be temporarily lifted until the CAS reaches a verdict.     
It's worth noting that penalty points no longer pass from one season to the next since 2012 (unless they changed ruling again), so if the tribunal decides that Rossi deserves either 3, 1, or zero penalty points, they will affect his next year penalty score even if they would have been expired otherwise.

In dramatic storytelling, emotional truth always beats objective truth. This is how ""Romeo and Juliet"" can take place in less than two weeks. In dramatic terms, the Baron thinks he is responsible for the death of his unborn daughter. This interpretation is in keeping with the Family Matters story as an allegory for alcoholism and domestic violence in the real world, and is the interpretation that gives the Baron's desire for redemption its emotional weight.

"thinkpad","t5_2qvhj","Even if you do not load the Windows 7 Lenovo Power Manager on windows startup and run the tools when you need them. It is worth the install.

The old Windows 7 tool kit as an option (battery maintenance) that allows the recognition of your battery by allowing the user to initiate a deep cycle charge. This fully drains the battery and recharges the battery a few times depending on the condition of the battery over a 3-6 hour period. In the past we have had this tool to restore 35-70% of extended time on the battery.

Wonderful performance increases: 
- 1-2 hours up to 3-4 hours of usage per charge cycle
- add six months to a year of life before having to replace the battery. 
- It is also recommended to do a maintenance cycle every six months or so to extend the life of the battery.

The new power management tool tells you that your battery is starting to fail as the old tool did and provides you with a “handy”  link on where to get a new battery.

Tested and Working on:
-	Yoga 12, Yoga S1, X230, X220
-	Windows 10, Windows 8.1

Note:
-	Windows 10 users will need both the driver and the power manager utility installed.

(Windows 10 users only)
Lenovo Power Management Driver for Windows 10 (32-bit, 64-bit) – Laptop 
http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/migr-4gxpeg

Power Manager for Windows 7 (32-bit, 64-bit), Vista (32-bit, 64-bit) – Laptop 
http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/ds014924

Installation:
When you install power manager it will unpack by default to: 
C:\DRIVERS\VISTA\PWRMGRV

It will then ask you to continue and install the program after it unpacks. 
This needs to be halted. You need to manually navigate where the program was unpacked. 

*Right click Setup.exe file.
*Click on Properties.
*Click on the Compatibility tab. 
*Check the Run this program in compatibility mode for box.
*Click on the drop down menu arrow and select Windows 7.
*Click on OK to apply the changes.

Now, double click Setup.exe file to start the installation.
Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.

Editing is about communication. It's about telling a story. Your brain is the best tool for this purpose. A good editor doesn't need to be sitting at a computer to cut.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","This game is a fuckload of fun. I've been playing on and off since the first release and it's still fresh a decade later. Truly the perfect blend between Arma, Battlefield, and RO2. 

For those who think they will be shit on for being new don't worry. Pick up a medic or rifleman kit, join a ""Mic Infantry"" squad and follow your squad leader. You'll be hero when a sniper picks off your machine gunner or the Anti Air fella needs ammo to save your team from a beastly close air support player. 

People will tell you to read the manual. They're not wrong. It's well written, illustrated, and opens up a lot of possibilities for emergent gameplay when you understand how capping/spawning/tickets and deployables work. 

Do: Use your microphone, call out direction if you are taking fire, help build shit for points and a closer spawn. Join a mortar squad and run ammo or perimeter defense, play as an insurgent and ambush a Bluefor patrol, or help spot for the commander to call in fire support with your binoculars. There are so many versatile roles and you can have a significant impact on the battle with any kit.

Don't: Grab advanced limited kits or vehicles without practicing (the test_airfield map can be downloaded and you've got an entire arsenal to play with). Don't drive the logistics truck into the enemy like a battlewagon. Most importantly, don't get discouraged. You're gonna die for your country.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

"news","t5_2qh3l","All shit that has nothing to do with my original point but thanks for the mini documentary.  I simply said the actions she took that day were not demanding of the reaction the officer took to remove her from the class.

You can keep spouting off about all this other shit but the discussion is two fold:  A) Do we have to respect ANY authority just because they deem themselves the master?  and B)  At what point is escalation good or bad.

The arguments used against me are that you HAVE to respect authority just because its authority, and that she because she was texting in class deserved to be physically touched by ANYONE.

I am arguing that both points are bullshit.  We are not robots, drones or yes men in this country.  We do not have to respect authority just because its deemed as such by another party.  You can argue all you want that is how it is, I am telling you it isn't how it should be.

Authority should ALWAYS be questioned.  More so if the authoritative person in question isn't being reasonable.  So right off the bat you and I will never see eye to eye if you can't agree with that point.  I am a person who doesn't believe in a master and follower paradigm.


Now here is the MOST important part of my debate:

Do I recognize the need for such systems?  Sure do.  But in this situation I have yet to read ANY report from teacher, police officers, or school that has said the child was disrupting the class.  Every single news report has said she was texting in class and refusing to put the phone away.

That is where part B comes into play for me and why I disagree with the majority of people who responded to me.  The action of taking the day off and sitting in your chair texting on a phone is not grounds for removal from class for me.  Never has been.  I never understood how if I have my head down in class and sleep because I am tired, I am ruining the learning for others.  I am not, its a bullshit excuse to use and one only used to excuse ""Authority"" figures from trying to impose their will on others.

Now we have this problem like Ive said multiple times where the average ""yes man"" in this thread will argue that her not listening to the teacher was grounds enough for her to be removed from the class...

But lets just jump away from that point and add the following:  Even if you are for turning kids into mindless factory workers who always say ""Yes Masta!"" when commanded, you can't imagine that the education the OTHER students got from the reaction of the officer HELPED their learning anymore then having left her alone would have?

Now we have walk outs, kids arguing about who is right or wrong, media on the other side of campus camped out waiting for interviews, yea, sure did fix that situation good!  Really made sure the learning ability of others was protected real well!

It's all bullshit.   What would have changed had the teacher not been offended the student wouldn't kowtow to his demand to put the phone away?  What if he had waited until after class, went to the VP and they suspended her.  If she does it again, I dunno, USE THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE AND EXPEL HER.

At NO point what this police officer did was correct procedure.  You can keep making apologetic bullshit responses about how hard it is to be a cop, how hard it is to expell a student, or all the lost wages the school gets for kicking her out, but in the end you are excusing EXCESSIVE use of force on a teen who was texting on a phone.

Like I said to the other guy, get the fuck outta here with that bullshit.

How many times faulty radars and bad intel nearly caused the annihilation of the human species? Yeah, those sand people are really the big threat here.

Humans can be a violent, warlike species at times. Religion does not propagate from this, it is morphed as a result, and sometimes, as a counter to this. Though I'm not an expert, I've remarked that the majority of Christian and Islam texts advocate peace, not horror, and can be interpreted in many different ways. Thus, though I myself am an agnostic, I don't view religion as the root of all evil. People cherry pick little bits and pieces to use it as an excuse for evil, but is it as a whole evil unto itself? Nope, I don't think so. Like humanity, there's many, many different shades to it. ","1446336857"

Think of countries like Germany, Japan, even the US and Canada (developing nations are a bit more complicated) whose population growth are below or nearing below replacement levels. But basically, eventually population can still be stable with low mortality if people just reproduce at replacement rates.

One time, I didn't realize that there's two bathroom entrances to the same bathroom right next to each other, so I saw a ladies room entrance and walked in and it was still the ladies room, so I just kinda backpedaled out.

I told him I just want him to assure me every time I get insecure that he loves me and wants me, and this is what he does now.

* Very slightly slower processor for a lot less. I'm betting you won't get over a frame of difference between this &amp; the 4690 in most games.

* You've got a Z97 motherboard which allows overclocking but a locked processor. Save money here on an H97 (could even go as low as B85 to really save money but since it fits it sits)

* With the money saved on the CPU &amp; the motherboard you have enough for a 250GB SSD. Install Windows &amp; your programs on this to make the system super fast.

* Swapped you to a more reliable HDD brand that's also cheaper

* The r9 380 &gt; the GTX 960 &amp; it has a memory bus that's fast enough to actually make use of the 4GB of vram unlike the 960.

* You'll want an AC wifi adapter for the speed boost + it's cheaper","1446336859"

&gt;Rim protection is nice but it isn't the end all of big man defense.

 I'd argue that kind of rim protection and help defense is more important than man to man post defense in todays NBA with how heavily used the PNR is used vs post ups.

&gt;That was in the same range as bigs like Al Horford and Robin Lopez--and no one seems to talk shit about their defense

Although not as strongly a splinter group as the  Temple of Set is, they still are Satanists and not atheists and non-theists as some members like to claim.

What I advice you to do is to smoke into your jungle and ward/deward it. Try to push out the lanes, build items that are good for a comeback(it is not smart to go for your standard build anymore). Even though you are behind you can make comebacks happen. 

Just one example: Push out a lane, while the enemy tries to destroy your tower, one or two people will always go back. Tp back to the attacked tower and defend it as 5. You will most likely win that fight and comeback from that.

That said, it is incredibly difficult to come back and since pubs lack teamplay you will lose 90% of the time.","1446336867"

"assassinscreed","t5_2s6v6","I was really relieved when both twins survived the game. I thought (dreaded really) that either twin would be killed off at the end. I don't know why I thought that but it's been a creeping suspicion since some of the early trailers really. I was so glad to be proved wrong though. I really liked the ending. Sure, it was a bit Disney, but still. I thought it was great. I don't think happy endings are necessarily bad. 

I liked the story too. I think it was a good plot without taking itself too seriously. The mission with the dog and mrs. Disraeli doing slum sight-seeing... I laughed so much.
I loved the Evie/Jacob interactions as well. I was hesitant at first but now I can understand why they put both characters in the game - it makes sense with their respective story missions and so on.

London looks really cool as well. And I love the soundtrack. As I said in another thread somewhere, it really adds to the atmosphere of London.

I haven't actually played the game myself though (yet!) as I don't have access to a console while at uni, I've only seen it been played, but I look forward to trying it myself now.","1446336872"

The same mistake is obviously made by a lot of people. 

And brown people is exactly the broad definition I fit under since as a mixed race mongrel people guess all of those things. Rarely Indian, but people have made that mistake too.

I don't need to show you guys my family tree and every 1/8th I am. This is about -perception-. It might be useful if I was just Spanish or something like that, but just brown is all I am. The only citizenship I have is Australian, but it's not like I am aboriginal (native Australian) or Anglo Celtic. And there are plenty of people like me who are mixed up 3rd generation immigrants.

You also don't have to get into South America for Hispanics to be dark. Southern Spain was ruled by the Islamic Empire for hundreds of years and the people mixed there too. There are dark Spaniards who have never mixed with Native Americans.","1446336873"

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","Keeping the law will not save you, but it is not optional. The promise is that we will be made to conform to it through faith. In time we can be made perfect through the sin pardoning Savior.

Sin is sin. Sin existed before the law was given on Sinai, and therefor the law did as well. Lucifer was cast out for sinning, and all ten of the commandments are demonstrated in the single command not to eat of the tree of the garden. We cannot continue to knowingly sin without the penalty of death. When we find that we've been sinning in ignorance, that's the next fault in our character which the Holy Spirit is showing us we need to fix.

Most people agree on nine of the commandments, but the Sabbath is right there in the eternally binding commandments of God as well. Breaking the Sabbath, the *seventh* day, is a sin. Most people don't have a problem with any of the others, but when you show them the Sabbath is still binding they suddenly want to throw out the entire law. It doesn't work that way.

God gives us the power through Jesus Christ to receive the strength we need to keep His law. We cannot do it on our own, and obedience is the manifestation of the Spirit. It is not something we do to be saved, but it is something we do inherently by the indwelling of His Spirit. When we have faith, it manifests outwardly in our works; the chief works being obedience.

John puts this well.

**1 John 2:1-7**
&gt;My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if
any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:  
 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also
for the sins of the whole world.  
 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and
the truth is not in him.  
 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected:
hereby know we that we are in him.  
 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he
walked.  
 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which
ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard
from the beginning.

God expects us to live up to the light we have. He has not changed; salvation today is the same as it was for Abraham. Instead of looking forward to the Messiah, as he did, we look backward to the Messiah. We have far more light than they ever did, and we have far less excuse for our behavior than they.

The system of sacrifices and the shadows of things to come were done away with at the cross because they pointed to Christ. The law, however, is not a shadow of things to come and neither is the Sabbath commandment within it. The law is eternally binding, and the Sabbath is a memorial to the creation of the world which has past. It is the sign between us and Him that we pledge ourselves to His allegiance.

Just as much as you're not to even think about committing murder... you shouldn't even think of breaking God's sabbath.

**Exodus 31:13**
&gt; Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations;
that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.","1446336877"

1. He only spoke Japanese. I found that annoying, even though I can understand Japanese. I heard it and liked how they used his native language, but I disliked the overuse of it. They should've split it between Japanese and English. 

2. It's obvious his story never continued. They gave him a pretty good story as to why he joins the Payday gang, and then they never continue it. That's just stupid. Jiro could've had a pretty good plot-line.

Sokol was a different story. I hated his addition. He was only loved due to 'Mother Russia"" hype. He was added in poorly. VERY poorly. 

I had a problem with almost every character addition except Old Hoxton, and Jiro. Jiro started to become an issue for me when it was clear they wouldn't continue his plot-line. That defeats the whole purpose of his addition.","1446336877"

"needadvice","t5_2r367","Just a thought.  You know, not everyone is that vested in their grandchildren.  My middle son is living with who he is probably going to end up married to, and I've told both of them at the same time that I am not even particularly interested in seeing any potential grands, until they are housebroke, walking and talking.  Maybe about 9-10'ish.  But that I'd be the best damned dog grandparent you'd ever seen.  Hell, I'd be willing to watch their future dogs for them for weeks on end, if they wanted to go on vacation.  I also let those same kids know that the Brooke Hospital for animals was probably going to get a bigger inheritance from me than they were.

I don't know about all old people, but...  I have long hated humans, and am not impressed by them at all.  Where I currently live, I don't have to see humans for weeks at a time, which is perfect.  I surround myself with things I love, and things that love me, and...  no drama, no chaos, no problems.

If I were to have a kid that had a SO that started trying to run my life, I'd cut that kid out of my life today.  Not next week, not next year, but starting with whatever time the clock said right now.

And...  think about it. She is financially comfortable, she is living in a home that is her own and makes her happy...  and you are asking her to leave that, to come be close to you, make your arguments with your wife null, and to be judged and labeled.  Leave the old gal the hell alone.  Let her keep living in a place that makes her happy, where she has friends, and knows what to expect from day to day life.

The other thing.  What if you get where you are going and flounder.  You can't keep the job, or the economy goes to shit, and the company goes under, or you get sick and can't pay your bills?  You are asking her to leave a life of comfort and security, to be around your lack of security.  I am only asking you to see it from her point of view.  700 miles is only about a 1 day drive.  That really isn't that much of a buffer, when you think about it.  Not if she values her privacy.","1446336879"

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","Exactly right. We have to get 4 and 5-star recruits because they can overcome poor strategy and scheme. 2 solid units of 3s and 4s that know their assignments with a few that break out under quality coaching is unheard of under Richt. One key injury and competing for Championship is over. Today showed they don't even understand the talent they do have, much less what to do with it.

I have a sneaking suspicion that the only reason Bauta played was because he was a senior and they wanted to give him the start for his last Florida game. The only reason you do that is because you have no confidence. Then your supposed #2 punts all night leading to the most telegraphed fake of all time? To give Marshall one carry in the first half is ridiculous. To go away from him when he's the only player gaining yards in the 3rd is just incompetent. Marshall should be delivering body blows to set up the Sony chin music all night with a couple of reverses for Mitchell thrown in.

They have very good build-up play, probably the third best in Spain. Altetico, Valencia, Villarreal also play high level, but they are more based on the counter, surprising rivals - so while hard opponents for anyone, they also look less impressive against sides that don't go open too much. Celta always plays nice football, has initiative, creates many chances.

For now, they are surely a team that looks like one of the candidates for third place. ","1446336881"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","75 million years ago, there was an alien galactic ruler named Xenu who was in charge of 76 planets in our part of the galaxy, including our own planet Earth, whose name at that time was Teegeeack.

All of the planets Xenu controlled were over-populated by, on average, 178 billion people. Social problems dictated that Xenu rid his sector of the galaxy of this overpopulation problem, so he developed a plan.

Xenu sent out Tax Audit demands to all these billions of people. As each one entered the audit centers for the income tax inspections, the people were seized, held down and injected with a mixture of alcohol and glycol, and frozen. Then, all 1.4 trillion of these frozen people were put into spaceships that looked exactly like DC8 airplanes, except that the spaceships had rocket engines instead of propellers.

Xenu's entire fleet of DC8-like spaceships then flew to planet Earth, where the frozen people were dumped in and around volcanoes in the Canary Islands and the Hawaiian Islands. When Xenu's Air Force had finished dumping the bodies into the volcanoes, hydrogen bombs were dropped into the volcanoes and the frozen space aliens were destroyed.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","I am pretty sure economics has a big role to play with their decision to target markets like India first. 

Reasons why this would be are :

1. It's faster for a new company like Oneplus to grow when they can sell to a growing market like India especially with mid range phones. Fastest growth would translate to a bigger company and more global presence in future. Plus easier to support to a narrower market that can saturate your production rather than a global market with a thinner support. 
2. Faster turn around time in terms of support/sales considering they are manufacturing in China/India. 
3. Less competition from IPhone/Samsung. Plus Iphone doesnt really have a mid range phone and Samsungs mid range is sub par and not in the value for money. Western markets will have folks willing to pay down more for an iphone/Samsung top end due to cost of living and this ends up as a harder battle for Oneplus.

These guys see a milestone they'd like to reach, and they create a solution to bridging the gap and reaching that milestone because they have an excellent understanding of the problem itself, and the tools in their toolkit.  I think its incredible that they come up with this stuff.  I just think it would be boring to play too.","1446336882"

&gt; L 2:21. We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit: let them die in their misery. For they feel not. Compassion is the vice of kings: stamp down the wretched &amp; the weak: this is the law of the strong: this is our law and the joy of the world. Think not, o king, upon that lie: That Thou Must Die: verily thou shalt not die, but live. Now let it be understood: If the body of the King dissolve, he shall remain in pure ecstasy for ever. Nuit! Hadit! Ra-Hoor-Khuit! The Sun, Strength &amp; Sight, Light; these are for the servants of the Star &amp; the Snake.

see, that's actually part of the problem: the islamic faith is explicitly meant to be followed to the letter. If you're not doing that then you aren't considered a proper muslim by the majority of your religion, instead you become an apostate or heretic. Islam can have no reformation because such a reformation is explicitly banned in the Quran!

&gt; they're becoming more and more American every year. Attacking the whole religion will only propagate hatred and make the modernization harder.

No. If they're becoming more american then they're just adapting to our rhythms of life rather than the chaotic mess of the middle east, where the vast majority of muslims reside and worship.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","Yes makes sense , but lets not forget that VS smgs are also not that great compared to the nc and tr ones . 

I have spent a lot of time with the VS smgs and have ran with Blitz and Armistice enough to notice what i will say below . 

The first gen   Eridani is just bad , super bad recoil makes it hardest to manage out of all 3 , has the lowest damage per mag . The advantage of extra 5 meters of full damage range is neglected by its pis poor recoil. It is Hands down the worst out of all 3 . [This guy makes similar points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHXafG2bKCc)  

The second gen Sirius is basically Blitz just with worse accuracy stats. It has the worst side by side recoil out of all SMG in the  game  so Blitz &gt; Sirius &gt; failstorm (even tho i prefer to have more accuracy witch it provides over Sirius and even Blitz (because of slower RPM ))


Personal ranking i would put VS smgs below all the other ones. Here is why i put sirius bellow hailstorm .  Sirius has TTK of 0.497 over the Hailstorms 0.525 giving the Sirius advantage of 0.028 seconds in shorter  TTK  (average human reaction speed almost 10 times as slow at 0.25s)  so judge if that is actually valid downside  yourself.  Now as for the advantages. The Hailstorm has better recoil than Sirius and the slower fire rate makes it even less necessary to burst what i find vital for all of the smgs at bit further than 15 m . 


I guess the vs had good lmgs the NC had good smgs and tr had good something , i know you had . ","1446336888"

My payday is always the last work day of the month. I always enter the date as the first of the next month. For example, this month, I was paid Oct 30, but I listed it in YNAB as Nov 1. (You do have to be a little careful if reconciling an account in this period). 

The main reason I do this is because I budget to zero each month, and I usually don't need this money for the month it was actually paid. (If I did, I would enter it as the actual pay date and assign what was needed to October and the rest to November). If I list the date as October, I can only assign it as income for October or November. If I list it as November, I can list it for November or December, which is better for budgeting to zero each month.

"bindingofisaac","t5_2sxpk","Just because they always have been, doesn't mean they always should be though. Angel rooms have always been shit, but we'd love for them to be buffed. I think we all unconsciously side with the ""make stuff stronger"" argument. We don't want to get fucked by item rooms, we hate guaranteed damage, we demand angel room buffs, but we frequently complain about the game's ease.

Now the problem, in my eyes, is that the items are overpowered. All of them. I'd personally have toned back every item in the game by like, 10-15% of its power, and just kept things a little more sane. The frequency of runs that you get one-shot potential on 95% of enemies is way too high, and it:

A. ruins enemy diversity, as they all just die

and B. forces difficulty increase to only be achievable through guaranteed damage or bullshit attacks. 

___

The game's in a spot where the high level players (most of this subreddit) and low level players need entirely different things from the balance perspective. To many it's far too hard, yet to the hardcore it's far too easy.

I think with the items toned down and a ""runoff floor"" (a floor that's full of shameless guaranteed damage, and is just unrealistically difficult (mega satans as normal rooms etc, maybe 2, go crazy)) for really OP runs to go die in, the whole difficulty thing would have been a little better off.

Naturally, we'd all have been fucking furious, but maybe that's a gamer's prerogative. ","1446336891"

A singular misstatement or misunderstanding about a thing wouldn't be much to go on. But if a whole cohort of students were duped, you very well might end up with a different outcome. 

Tortious misrep can actually happen apart from a contract issue. And if by way of showing through the evidence garnered from other students that the agent of the school intentionally misrepresented information to the students, with the intent for them to rely on that false information, you can still make a cause of action. 

The whole thing though is that misrep is relying on proof that misrep happened. And where the paper evidence is one thing, you'd need a body of other folks (or some sort of smoking gun email) to support the claim. It would be hard, but it is plausible.","1446336892"

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","The slug hate is real.  

I never played Abathur in Hero League- I would never dare.  At this point in the game, the win %'s on Hotlogs are completely confounded because even hovering your mouse of Abathur during draft invokes toxicity which greatly hurts your team's chances of winning.  

I played him up to level 10 on QM, and even then, I got a lot of complaints.  (Earlier on, when I was still learning, that was fine, but towards the end when I started to get good- the flaming never stopped).  

I used to be part of the bandwagon that would agree that Abathur is highly situational, that he is very comp-dependent, and that he is weak on most maps.  All of these things are false for 95% of the games that you will play.  He can contribute more than most heroes if played correctly- higher EXP contribution, map control, help during skirmishes, and with UE, even full participation during team fights.  There are not many maps where he is weak in. (Mostly maps where you don't have prolonged objective periods and few hiding spots, like Tomb of the Spider Queen).  

People are dumb and you're going never going to break the cultural stigma - any team composition problems Abathur brings can always be made up with superior skill level (and this is easy to compensate for especially if you are below Rank 5 on Hero League).  Abathur also requires a *different* skill set than other heroes.  Map awareness, timing, and lots of knowledge of how other Heroes play, how players move, etc..  These are things that can give your team a huge edge over other teams just because you have an Abathur on your team.  He also has *extreme* flexibility in his builds.  So once again, team composition weaknesses can be made up with your talent choices too, and are highly map dependent.  

As someone with no ""mains"" - I can play almost every hero in the game, the knowledge that I bring to the table when playing Abathur, not to mention the muscle memory associated with mechanical skills required to appropriately play my UE helped a lot.  

Just don't listen to people.  Carry them, and let them judge you *after* the game.  ","1446336896"

"AskMarketing","t5_2vqfw","Wow, thank you so much for the advice! Some of these things I considered doing. Many people know about those shows and many are very close to actually showing up to classes, We have on average 7 people per class which is very little, compared to the potential we could have. There are so many gyms, clubs, and restaurants in this city to make us very irrelevant. Plus some people have told me that there is not a significant ""need"" to learn ballroom or Latin-style dancing. The people that come are looking to prepare for a wedding or an occasional night out. I would agree that many people like to dance but are not willing to take the extra step to learn from professionals.

That being said, my city population is just under 100,000 people and our core target demographic is male and female (however, mostly females come in to learn, men do not have the same emotional ambition). We target a very large core, ages 30-50. We focus on classes for adults. Just one class per weekday. One dance party a week. No classes for kids, however young adults do tend to come in (19-25 years old). 

Thank you for the digital ad campaign advice. How do I start to do this with Facebook, and appear to those only interested? 

Dance is a wonderful visual medium. I know many people who said they started because they were inspired by Dancing With The Stars. Would you use photography as a paid service? Or part of the packaged deal? Our franchise takes many videos and photos of people during the lessons, and it helps a little, but not as much as I had hoped. We have thousands of followers on our instagram and Facebook accounts. It just seems we keep getting middle aged women inspiring by TV Shows or looking to get in shape. We want to expand to a more youthful target demographic. Should we create zumba'like classes?
Sorry if I seem all over the place. We are running for many years but we keep having very low revenue, enough for good profit, but I know we can do better and bring in more males once young females start coming in.

When you select an in system destination such as a station, star, planet, etc, you want to line up with it, throttle up to 100% and engage your frame shift drive (j). This will put you into supercruise and allow you to fly very quickly towards your destination. When you get close enough you can drop at your destination.  You have to manually pilot in this stage so use your throttle.

On the bottom left of the screen you will see two bars that will show you your speed and distance. You will want to be in the blue area in both metrics then tap (j) again to drop where you want to be. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now witch space is different. If you lock onto another system, you throttle to 100% and hit (j) you will jump to the next system over as long as you're in range. You can't manually pilot while jumping. After jumping, you then manually pilot in supercruise to your next destination in that system.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","The PSU *was* $39.99 last night, but prices do change. Who knows.

I highly suggest that you pick *at least* a tier 2 (or 3 at worst) 600 watt supply (see tier chart [here](http://i.imgur.com/yoFsqFv.png)), to accommodate future video card upgrades. A 500 watt supply limits you to a 970 at best, and you'd need to pay for a new power supply if you wanted something more powerful in the future, such as a 980 Ti. Best to work the cost into a new system build now, rather than essentially pay twice for a PSU if you want to upgrade down the road.

Also, I wasn't able to find official power supply specifications for the AMD card I specced for you, but forum posts suggest that it needs a **650** watt supply.

I hope the Skylake build I put together for you works out, let me know.","1446336901"

GURPS can be used to create games of rich depth in any setting - and the books have always been tool kits, so http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/fantasy/ will let you dial the magic at whatever level you like.","1446336901"
"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","&gt;Perhaps I didn't articulate the problem clearly enough.

You did, and I get the problem. I just do not get what holds you in this situation.

&gt;My SO is not a selfish asshole, and I am in no way being his apologist.  He literally does not see that he has completely separated his sex life from our love life.  He has an addiction, compulsive behavior that he cannot control and he is not -- at this point, for whatever reason -- able to see that nor is he able to address it.

I did not necessarily think he was selfish or an asshole, but his actions in the context of your relationship are thoughtless at best. If you have let him know how his across affect you, then it is callous and uncaring. 

&gt;Frankly, the thing that keeps me sane is knowing that it is an addiction.  If he were addicted to anything else, his addiction would likely affect our relationship; it's the nature of this addiction that contributes to how I feel.

Labeling this as an addiction and saying that it allows you to maintain your sanity sounds like a way for you to justify that it is ok to remain in this situation. 

&gt;As I said in my original post, life is a complicated thing.  

It can be, but it depends on you and how you view it. Life is only as complicated as you choose to make it. If you stay in this, you are setting yourself up for continued heartache and disappointment.

From your posts, I still cannot garner why he is powerless to change, and why you are compelled to stay. You are not married, and it sounds like you have no kids and live apart.

I am sympathetic to how unhappy this is making you, and wish you all the joy and sex you deserve. He is quite fortunate to have you in his life. But think twice about what this is costing you and decide if this is what you want your life to be. If he hasn't got himself together by 47, I would be doubtful that he will by 48, 49, 50, etc. Especially if he thinks his behavior is fine.

I also cannot help but wonder if anything would really be different if he stopped with all the porn. Have you discussed this with him? Does he understand how despondent you are? ","1446336901"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","I'm checking this match http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1905238447

Some thoughts as I'm watching:

- Boots first is generally a no no unless you know what you're doing. In this case it allowed you to chase down the Enigma and PL at the rune, but you didn't commit to chasing just one of them and thus ended up not getting any XP or Gold for the kill on Enigma.

- Bring some sort of regen to lane, it allows you to trade hits with the enemy easier. Bringing mana regen (1 mango/1 clarity) can be a good idea when playing LC, because her nuke is good for harassing.

- Almost always try to hit as many units with Overwhelming Odds as possible. There are times in the early game where two enemies are standing in a full creepwave and you don't use it, only to use it on the Enigma and one other creep when he was running away.

- The second point in Press the Attack before Overwhelming Odds wasn't wasn't really worth it, you should always max Overwhelming Odds first generally. (Unless you're jungling, then you can get an extra point or two in Moment of Courage).

- Don't stand in Enigma's Midnight Pulse. lol Everyone stands in it, so he maxed it first. Probably not a good idea to start a duel in it either. (Since Enigma maxed it first if you don't walk in it, he's basically wasted 4 skill points on a zoning skill)

- It's difficult to keep in mind (I did see you do it), but you should always switch to int treads before using Press the Attack and if you're in a safe place (ie. under your tower) keep it on int/agi treads until Press the Attack has finished healing you.

- At one point Enigma is pushing top with a *tonne* of eidelons and you tp'd directly on top of the eidolons in order to try and kill/repel Enigma. If you had tp'd to the side of the tower (in the tree line) you could have used Overwhelming Odds from out of vision and immediately blinked on top of Enigma for the duel before he could use Midnight Pulse.

- You tried to duel Tiny when you had already seen that Enigma and Techies were also in the lane. Since Tiny has a built in LC counter with Craggy Exterior and Enigma has both Midnight Pulse and Malefice, you had basically no chance of getting that kill. On top of this you were only 500 gold from BKB so all you did was set yourself back (**a lot**).

- Immediately after failing the duel you decide to abandon trying to kill Tiny and go for Enigma. The correct decision here would be to try to run away.

- Trying to duel Techies instead of Enigma in the team fight with your BKB. Enigma was the only one who could disable you during your BKB (and also the only one who could do any real damage.)

- Maybe buy some sort of vision for techies mines and push with your team.

Well that's about where I'm gonna stop. You've got a lot of stuff right for a 1k player (tread switching, last hitting, some item decisions).

Really the most important points are taking some sort of regen to lane and working on your decision making and knowing when to commit to a kill. If you continue to improve those points, I'm pretty sure you can boost your MMR without having to worry about your team.

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","Well ""easy stomp noob build"" seems to be the way to go well into Rank 1. As for why, it's because serpent adds the most to healing and damage throughput. The main alternatives are blind builds which isn't a huge benefit since barring going for 4 target to try and hit ranged people such as Raynor you wont have much issue hitting a Sonya or most other divers. Lili tends to be in a bad spot to hit ranged attackers anyways because she wants to stand somewhere she can juggs without being interrupted.","1446336906"

"mbti","t5_2s90r","&gt;Blatantly states his disregard for functions and bases his work off the stereotypes/eight letters.

How is this a bad thing? He's just building a different model based off different ideas. Jung's cognitive functions isn't the ultimate in personality modelling.

Perhaps the main difference between the two (as far as I understand; sorry, I haven't read any of the books, only online material) is that stereotypes are too specific and focused, barely capturing the variation in personality, while MBTI is too vaguely defined and too malleable. We need unambiguous, concrete ideas for MBTI to be useful.

MBTI arguably also has the problem with stereotypes because in trying to synthesize concrete ideas of personality, we end up forming stereotypes like what [16personalities](http://www.16personalities.com/personality-types) does. [This comment from another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/3qzzbr/which_mbti_type_is_most_likely_to_be_downvoted_on/cwjqeg5) is another example of synthesizing the functions into stereotypes. So not only is the framework useless as a predictor, but people are still boxing types into stereotypes. Though, this isn't necessarily a problem if we consider this stereotyping to not be an official part of MBTI. I haven't read up enough about MBTI to be able to discuss that.","1446336908"

We don't need to win fights, just gain advantages in some way. Nothing I do seems to convince my team. Talking with another diamond friend of mine, we came to the conclusion that I should be willing to have waves hit my tower, even if it means those minions would kill my tower, just in order to group up in case a fight breaks out.","1446336910"

Also the Russian early generations of reactors are all breeders. They use low enriched uranium and as a byproduct of making plutonium for bombs also generate vast amounts of heat that needs to be removed from the process. Electrical generation is an afterthought, not the primary function.","1446336911"

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","Okay, but consider the following:

- Falcon has been around since Smash 64, a game in which he _was_ relevant, and nobody in 64 has been dropped.
- see above for Ness.
- Fire Emblem is always relevant around the time each Smash is released, even if Marth isn't always the one important to said games. Marth is basically the most popular lord of out the entire series anyway (as far as I know). Roy ended up in Melee due to being more relevant than Marth and easy to code, if I recall correctly, with what little time they had, and the fact that he returned as DLC in 4 is almost entirely because he's a veteran with much more fans behind him than any other [other than M2, and debatably Wolf of Spoopas].
- Duck Hunt and G&amp;W are gaming icons on a level Isaac and K. Rool aren't and at this rate never will be

isaac and k. rool don't have relevance, importance or otherwise going for them beyond their to-each-their-own fan following, and considering they seemingly aren't going to be relevant for a while (I'm just assuming that for Isaac, but I'm absolutely sure K. Rool isn't gonna be seen around for a long time) their chance of inclusion shrinks each game.","1446336913"

"itookapicture","t5_2r1tc","Hello ITAP, the photos here are almost universally AMAZING.  You are all crazy photographic wizards!  I have two questions/issues/things i'd love you to help me about:

1) I love cats and volunteer as a kitten foster for a shelter.  In my own opinion, one of the most valuable things we can do to help get cats adopted is publish attractive photos.  I spent today at the shelter photographing all the cats that are there.  I'd love some feedback and sugestions and tips.  Here's a link to the entire album:  http://imgur.com/a/eJciV/all

1b) I know that I had one problem in today's shoot, which is that I shot almost entirely at f/1.8 and most of the photos fail to have the entire face in focus.  Shooting at something more like 2.2-ish or even smaller might have solved that, and I'll be doing that in the future.  

2) My other major area of photography is when I travel, to places like the middle east or India.  And I'm pretty horrible at getting any shots that could qualify as artistic.  Every single post in this subreddit is better than anything I've ever snapped.  So I'd love to know if there's some general guide or book or anything that I should read up on before my next trip (to Dubai, in February).  Please help me!

This isn't true once the system gets large enough.

The universe *cannot* be an integrated system because there are parts of it which are causally isolated from other parts of it due to the speed of light.

&gt; but what about just after the Big Bang (assuming it ""happened"")?

Just after the big bang, the universe was a hot, dense plasma without anything recognizable as structure.

It was so energetic that the four fundamental interactions were not yet distinct from each other, in which there was nothing recognizable as matter as we know it.

Additionally; space can expand faster than the speed of light, and during the initial moments of the universe when radiation energy drove the expansion of the early universe, it was expanding at faster than the speed of light (while nothing can move faster than the speed of light, there's no boundary to space expanding faster than the speed of light) - this is what lead to the now-visible structures in the cosmic microwave background, so at that point there were parts of the universe causally isolate from each other as well.","1446336916"

Your offense should've never been dependant on just one player. Georgia has monster recruiting classes year after year, and y'all can't get a TD vs a UF team in rebuilding mode starting our backup QB. You lose ONE player and all of a sudden the season is over. That's not bad luck, that's a failure to plan by the coaches.


It's not going to get any easier. Floridas offense will only get better as mcelwain fills in recruits. Same with auburn and defense and Tennessee too.

&gt; We do not hate you or anyone else for the color of her skin. What we hate is a system that confers privileges (and burdens) on people because of their color. It is not fair skin that makes people white; it is fair skin in a certain kind of society, one that attaches social importance to skin color. When we say we want to abolish the white race, we do not mean we want to exterminate people with fair skin. **We mean that we want to do away with the social meaning of skin color, thereby abolishing the white race as a social category.** Consider this parallel: To be against royalty does not mean wanting to kill the king. It means wanting to do away with crowns, thrones, titles, and the privileges attached to them. In our view, whiteness has a lot in common with royalty: they are both social formations that carry unearned advantages.","1446336916"

Almost all servers get either 1 free meal per shift, or 50% off a meal during their shift, but that is besides the point. They are making minimum wage. Why are they not able to eat, but everyone else earning minimum wage is able to eat?

What *specifically* about the profession of server makes it so that they need tips, and you support them getting tips, but the person at WalMart can get fucked for all you care?

The more time and detail you put into something the less and less likely you are to want to change/fix it. Breaking something you already put together will just let you put it back together better.

The benefit of such few colors is it lets you view it as more of a silhouette, and that goes along with ""attitude"". Another quickie to demonstrate that. Once you get that silhouette working by solving his attitude, you will have a much stronger base to start working out those details on top of.

I personally like the first one the most. Keep in mind that for many people, your thumbnail may just appear as a tiny little square in their ""subscriptions"" column. For that reason, I'd stay away from #2 and #3, because the detail gets a little lost with a size reduction. In contrast, I think #1 and #4 are instantly recognizable and preserved even at a smaller size.

I know a lot of channels (and YouTube itself!) use red, so I'd understand if you choose not to go with #1. My reason for preferring it is based on red catching the eye, but also because it offers more contrast to your face than #4 (despite the blue being quite bright and pretty).

I'd also consider yellow as a background, if you were considering it.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","You are making all this up based on your own biases and without a shred of empirical evidence. 

There is no basis besides ""truthiness"" for anything you've written.  

If it's a topic you're interested in, I suggest you study the physical biology of it.  Unfortunately the technology of that science isn't advanced enough to show the *actual* physical connections between biology, chemistry and BEHAVIOR.

Sociological studies, on the other hand, show that these skills vary more widely *within* members of the biological sexes than *between* the biological sexes.  Moreover, studies have consistently shown that to the extent that there is measurable differences in gender performance (e.g., average math scores, spatial awareness), **those differences diminish as markers of gender equality increase in particular societies**.  In other words, women don't perform worse on math tests than do men, *American* women perform worse on math tests than *American* men.  That's in the aggregate.  It's highly unlikely that, say, you could outperform my mom on a math test.  

That's what science has to say on the subject.  That's pretty much it.

By the way, I took my degree in sociology and my husband is literally a behavioral scientist at one of the top medical schools in the country.

I spent that time applying through jobs in my phone which is something I could have done at home much faster and better. 

It is forcing people into labour at a cheap rate. They have to be very careful about how they do it because if you are forcing someone to work more than a few days a week it is just a roundabout way of getting around paying someone below minimum wage.

You should feel the mood at one of these groups. It is really depressing, most people there genuinely want to work but there is a lot of lifers and people with anxiety/depression.","1446336925"

"austrian_economics","t5_2stjd","&gt; If those are the matters on which you require agreement, then you have it.

I don't have a deep understanding of the terms used, but they seem reasonable enough to agree with. As for (1), I will agree that they are algebraically equivalent, but will note that the concept of marginal rates of technical substitution may not be sufficient to communicate the actual dynamics of microeconomics. (I've never heard of it, so I would bet there is some Austrian qualm about it being too mathematicized or idealized to fully communicate the actual economic law as reasoned from the axioms, but I'll ignore that to allow you move forward.)

I can see the link between the Austrian conception of free markets and cybernetics, but I'm not sure how much assistance I can offer in either helping you toward proving what you want to prove or in debating you to help you sure up your ideas. I'll be the first to say I don't know very much at all about the neoclassical school (and even less about cybernetics, a term I hadn't seen before yesterday). Judging from my barely understanding what you're saying here, I expect any forward progress is going to involve a lot of hand holding and effort on your part; I somewhat doubt I'll be able to give you a sufficient return on your investment.

That said, the idea of the market as a mind of sorts is certainly very interesting.

&gt; Running these demonstrations ‘in reverse’ then reveals the boundary of technical and utility tradeoffs to [be] temporally steady, and therefore serviceable as descriptors of macro entities.

So basically, your idea is to take Hayek's later conception of the market as an instance of the general idea of a complex system and use this to justify a mathematical, empirical treatment of macroeconomics?

&gt; The impediment seems to be Mises; and even he called for a rational understanding of how markets come to generate efficient prices. Maybe my view is warped, but I see today’s Austrians citing Mises against all earlier and later impulses toward anything else. Might Mises have been willing to reconsider his pre-conceptions upon seeing an attractive, objective understanding of free markets?

He did lay out the ""Austrian methodology"" more completely than anyone else before him (and maybe even after him). It's okay to do economics with other methodologies, but it wouldn't make sense to call that ""Austrian"" anymore, since you've left the core of it behind. I would guess that's why his ideas in some sense define the boundary between of Austrianism and other schools, and why his ideas are used internally to regulate what is allowed into canon and what isn't. It's more what is being done and how than who is doing it that decides whether something should be considered within or outside of Austrianism, IMO.","1446336931"
