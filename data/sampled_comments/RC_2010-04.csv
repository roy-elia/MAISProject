But the best thing ever is a good candyflip, mellowed out at the ending with some sweet herb. You get the mind expansion of LSD, the euphoric empathy and sociability of MDMA framed in by the general pleasantness of smoking a good joint/bowl. Should not be done too often.

Edit: seems I forgot the _why_.. Alright, I enjoy LSD because it's enlightening, you never know what you're gonna experience and it always exposes something from your inner life that always has been there but you never noticed. MDMA is the ultimate social experience, I simply end up being a much more nice person, and my social shyness dissipates. Together they amplify each other.

Everything else has too many side effects to enjoy the exalted status of the almighty herb.  A perfect balance of casual recreational life enhancement, and mental enlightenment.  The only negative side effect weed has on my life is a depleted bank account and a healthy distrust of law enforcement and the government.

LSD and Psilocybin are great but not something that I would want to do (or can do) with a great regularity.  I have gained much from my experiences, but they require too much mental and time commitment to enjoy with much frequency.  And it seems to be the laws of diminishing returns with their usage, the more you do them, the less significant the experiences become.  The same could be said for others like DMT and mescaline.

Stimulants (like coke,speed, and impure street ecstasy) are too addictive and make me jittery.  They can be fun in the right atmostphere, but not my favorites.

Alcohol is a great social drug, but the downsides (HANGOVERS!) are too severe.  herb doesn't give hangovers, it cures them!

Opiates are too destructive on my body, they tend to make me feel equally ill and high.  Not to mention the dangers of their dependence.","1270080039"

In other words, Christ became human to identify with humans.  The fact that he was human is far more important than what type of human he is, and I think that presenting pictures of him in a way that identifies him with the group most likely to see those pictures illustrates this theological fact quite nicely.","1270080053"

[Marlyand Financial Aid](http://www.mhec.state.md.us/financialaid/apply.asp)  
  
You said you were a student, so this should be destination 1.  Financial aid often gives you more than enough to pay for classes (living expenses, in other words).  Also, have you filled out a FAFSA?  Loans are a bitch, but paying a bunch later is better than being homeless and dropping out of school.  
  
[Maryland family Investment](http://www.peoples-law.org/income/gov-ben/family_investment_program.htm)  
  
This could also be a help.  Basically MD's version of welfare.  No shame in taking assistance when you need it; you will be paying into this when you get a job.  
  
[Maryland Foodstamps](http://www.dhr.state.md.us/fiaprograms/fstamp/index.php)  
  
If it comes down to it, know what you need to do to keep eating.  Foodstamps aren't just for the homeless.  If you have a place to stay but you're spending every dime on rent, this might be the way you get a dinner.  
  
[Maryland Unemployment Help](http://www.layoffsurvivalguide.com/unemployment-Maryland.html)  
  
I haven't looked at this too closely, but it might have vital information for you.  
  
The most important thing I can say is, don't give up.  True story: I had a friend in college who got kicked out of housing because the RAs wanted him to rat out a friend for using pot.  He himself had done nothing wrong, but because he wouldn't rat out his friend, he lost his right to housing.  He was part of a student group that had exclusive access to a student lounge on campus.  There were maybe 10 of them and faculty never checked up on them.  Everyone else banded together and cleaned out a storage closet in the lounge and he lived there for a year.  He bummed showers off of friends in various dorms.  
  
The point is, keep an open mind.  A couple years of inadequate living situations will be worth it when you get your degree.  The job market is pretty close to rock bottom right now so its only going to get better.  You might make some concessions in your lifestyle you'd never have considered making before, but you'll make it.  ","1270080091"

BUT, that program and Title V seem different. I got to a CNN post about it (seemed less biased) and it had these things to say about qualifying for Title V:

&gt;Programs that receive this funding must ""teach that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems,"" according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To qualify, they must also teach that sex before marriage is ""likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects."" These are part of the ""A-H definition,"" requirements for programs to receive abstinence funding under Title V of the Social Security Act.

The second one seems pretty horrible to me. It also doesn't seem like there are requirements for discussion of contraceptives or safer sex, which means they could be left out entirely. That is bad and means schools that get title V don't have to have conprehensive sex ed with abstinence promotion, they can have plain old abstinence-only ed.","1270080110"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A simple but deadly drinking game - **FIVES**

Okay, so you need a least three people to play this game. As with any drinking session though - the more the merrier! Before the game starts, you need to get one empty pint glass and place it in the middle. Everyone in the group pours a bit of whatever alcoholic drink they have in their own glass (beer, vodka, baileys etc.) into the empty glass to make the ''dirty pint''. The person who loses this game has to drink the ''dirty pint'' which should be kept in the middle.

Now onto the game itself. The aim of the game is to guess the total number made by the group. When you guess correctly you're out of the group and are safe from drinking the ''dirty pint''.

Everyone keeps one hand behind their back and on the count of three they place their hand in the middle revealing what they've decided to do (a bit like when you play rock, paper, scissors). Now you can do two things:
1) Keep your hand **opened** to indicate the number 5;
2) Keep your hand **clenched** in a fist to indicate the number 0.

So, you go round the group one-by-one saying out loud what you think the total number will be. If it is your turn to guess the total number you still have to put your hand in the middle and indicate a 5 or a 0. You have to shout out your guess whilst the ''1,2,3 - show'' count is being made.

For example, we have a group of four people. Mid-way through the count of three - Person 1, guesses that the total number will be '15'. After the count of three, all four people show their hands. Three of the four have their hands open (3x5), whilst the other one has their hand clenched (1x0). In this instance, the total number in the group is 15 , so as Person 1 guessed correctly s/he is out of the game and can drink their own drink at their own pace. (Although, its wise not to drink to much of your own drink whilst playing this game because it may inhibit your ability to finish off the ''dirty pint'' if you lose the game). Person 1 can then watch as the others get anxious and nervous because the probability that they'll have to drink the ''dirty pint'' has just increased. Its gets awesome to watch but nerve-racking to play, when its gets down to the final two people.

Its a bit of a long-winded explanation but hope its clear. Have fun!","1270080114"

Within a day of owning the car it started sputtering and couldn't make any power.  I checked basic stuff buy couldn't find anything.  We got in touch to say, hey this isn't what we agreed on, this car isn't working and we trusted you that it would be.  Past the first one where they confirmed they hadn't done *anything at all* to it in the interim period they wouldn't return any phone calls and wouldn't even come to the door, for weeks.  That's the closest I've ever come to vandalizing someone's house (but didn't.)  


I was so disgusted with it I let it sit.  Turns out ""not doing anything"" was actually cleaning the engine bay by blasting it with water - since I had noticed the engine bay was quite clean they specifically denied having done so.   Once I got over my anger and realized they lied about not having done anything it was obvious they had no idea or made a mistake when cleaning the engine bay.  I removed the spark plugs and let it dry out over a couple weeks.  Car ran just fine after that.


They directly lied to me about not having done anything, if they'd just told me the fucking truth I would have figured it out much sooner and not lost them as a friend.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Creation screams chaos, not god.  There not only doesn't have to be a supreme being, but most likely there isn't in the sense of a god.  Maybe more advanced alien cultures, or even more advanced cultures who may have existed epochs ago (such as the legend of Atlantis), but no fairytale god.  

Saying that all cultures have a supreme being in no way confirms that there is one, seeing as how most religions evolved from one set of beliefs.  Since the major religions are based on pagan beliefs, they've since simply been manipulated and evolved into what they are now.

Just as you say, you were brought up to believe.  Since generation after generation people have been doing everything in their power to convince each other of a god, obviously most people will believe in it blindly.

Sorry to also put your other beliefs down, but at the time of Jesus, there were several hundred other messiah's.  It was by chance and a dash of coincidence that Jesus was chosen to be the representative of the son of god.  Keep in mind, that even in the same geographical areas there were quite a few messiah's also claiming they were the sons of god.  To add the the sad reality of the lie people are ""brought up"" to believe is that there really is no archeological proof Jesus really existed, since the first mention of Jesus is near 80 years after his supposed death and reincarnation. If he was such an important figure, don't you think someone would have mentioned him in those 80 years or so?  I believe the first mention would have been by King James himself, whom coincidentally also set Jesus's birth date to what we accept it as now.  

And I'm not about to call you narrow-minded, however blind belief is just that.  Projecting your beliefs on the world you live in because you think anything amazing must be of god is simply turning your back on the evolution of human understanding, scientifically and spiritually.","1270080127"

I went to school for biochemistry, but ended up working in IT. The kitchen is basically my lab fix. I suggest eating critically, pay close attention to everything about the food that you eat when you are out and about, and keep that in mind when you are developing a strategy for reproducing it at home.

Good ingredients also help, and so does good equipment, you could be having a hard time getting things to taste right because your cookware is reacting to your dinner. Also, you need to learn to cook rice. Westerners have no idea how to cook rice, the best rice in the world is made by Iranians, so I suggest picking up a cookbook by Namijah Batmanlij and really get your rice skills going. It'll help when you are doing biryani or pulao or yakhni.

"DoesAnybodyElse","t5_2r5vt","I learned that the hard way.

My fiance proposed to me with a white twist-tie he'd twisted into a ring, asking if I'd marry him when he could afford a ring (of course I didn't care if he could afford one or not).

Struck by genius, though, I decided to take it to a local jeweler's and see if they could make mold for a real ring based on the twist-tie. They got really excited, but I would have to leave the twist-tie with them so they could take time molding it and making the ring.

In the meantime, I'd been wearing the twist-tie just like a regular ring, so I had to find another white bread tie to wear so he didn't know something had happened to the original. I was in the bread aisle for almost a fucking hour trying to find a white tie. A couple times the produce guy kept looking at me like I was insane, and eventually came over asking if he could help me.

I finally found a loaf with a white tie on the bottom shelf in the very back.

It took something like four or five weeks before I got the ring and original tie back, but the ring is fucking awesome; silver and a CZ, so it wasn't expensive, but it's better than anyone else's engagement ring. (Will post pics tomorrow if requested)

**UPDATE**: [Pictures!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/48929047@N02/sets/72157623624776333/) My favorite part is actually the underside of the ring, which is distinctly twist-tie-y. It's either a size 6 1/2 or 7, and I went for a pretty small CZ so the ring was really mostly a twist-tie. Most people just think it's a unique ring until I tell them the story, and then they freak out. I included a picture of the original twist-tie, as well as the two of us in the same fifth grade class (he switched schools the next year, I asked him to go on a date with me, and then I didn't see him for 11 years) -- and the two of us now.

My commitment to the game was way more than is involved in ANY MOVIE.  The longest movie I've ever watched was Solaris.  And that was only 5 hours or whatever.  

Everyone thought I was insane for watching Solaris, a five hour movie.  How much moreso am I insane for investing 60 hours in a game!

Hmm... If you want to compare games to something, try a TV series.  They have a large time commitment and require learning a lot about the characters and plot.  Following a TV series religiously is kinda popular... but not as popular as watching the occasional movie.  Maybe certain kinds of games could compared to TV series.  What do you think?

In other words, it's like someone asking how to create and use a `Map&lt;String,Integer&gt;` in Java.  Once you've explained how to call a constructor, and explained a bit about generics, and explained about iterators (or about the special `for` loop syntax), you've answered their question.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I linked to a study that problematizes the belief that boys are /naturally/ (which is what I meant by 'intrinsically') better at math than girls. It doesn't disprove the belief, you're right, but it certainly brings it into question, which is of value since the finding of the study is that the belief that girls are worse at math then boys is itself a major cause of girls scoring worse at math than boys. I think this is a terrific application of the scientific method, and one with moral significance (in a negative sense, in that it problematizes a source of legitimation for sexism and suggests that certain social assumptions that people make in their interactions should be reevaluated). Anyway, it was a throwaway example on which none of my arguments relied. In two other places I said clearly that science is ""great"" in certain applications. And I fully believe that. I never suggested, nor do I think any of the above can be reasonably construed as suggesting that ""good science does not exist."" (edited for clarification... I always apparently see things I want to elaborate on as soon as I hit the ""save"" button). 

Edit: Also... whether or not there is some natural advantage for men at the highest levels of abstract math and physics is still debated (see the Larry Summers controversy), but the history in academia (as in society in general) of institutionalized sexism is pretty uncontroversially accepted as the primary cause underlying the persistent, though gradually eroding disparity.

Koch spent $12.3 million on lobbyists in 2009, ranking it fifth behind Exxon, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips Co. and BP PLC.

&gt; Environmentalists, meanwhile, have increased their lobbying expenditures fourfold during that same period, spending $22.5 million last year. **Greenpeace spent $46,291 on lobbyists in 2009, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.**

I agree, and that's the issue. But it's not as simple as that because the definition of death that is currently used is ""brain"" death, which is not the same as a persistent vegetative state that has CNS function and a small, very small, possibility of allowing the individual to function in society again at some point. Right now in most states, if there is no living will, the preferences of the family might not be enough to get the hospital to take off the respirator (see Missouri v Cruzan).

Brain death is tricky because it involves all functions of the brain, so even if your brain is still secreting hormones and causing involuntary twitches, your brain is alive when there may be no hope of restoring consciousness. This is where the slippery slope argument comes in, but that's another, longer issue in itself... ","1270080460"

Later I had to stand naked in front of my mother while she pulled the splinters out. Then I had to explain to the gym teacher at the ""Christian"" school I attended that I didn't want to dress out (shorts and t-shirt) because I was embarrasses from the whelps on my body. The teacher of course did nothing because Dad was just following God's will to beat his children.

I didn't love my father again until I was 30 and finally called him on it and told him I was going to kick his ass. He begged my forgiveness and we cried and we healed our relationship and were close until his death.

""I drove down that road again, and the posted limit was 35,"" he says. ""I figured the judge wouldn't accept that, since I was over the speed limit, and would still charge me with it.

Doh!  That is *exactly* how judges let you off tickets.  All you have to do is disprove one major point on the report and you get off.

Thank you so for for the link, as well! That doesn't look like any organization I remember hearing about, but the fact that you have to pass that in for your contribution to be agreed with by the heads of that church proves that it is still going on even now. From what I have gathered, it used to be much more common with certain flavors of Christians and Mormons in years past; it looks like either the reports I remember hearing about, or cries from their congregations halted the practice in a lot of places. It looks like social control is used more now as opposed to tax records (Mormons will even stop you from attending a family wedding if you 'owe' them money), but they effectively lead to the same place.

You can always work on improving yourself, but you're not going to find a magic set of rules to imitate, especially if you keep being down on yourself for not getting as many girls as your buddy or something.

If you're versatile and enjoy a lot of things, I'd think that would make things easier on you if you *were* to go back to school and grab a different degree. The first year or so of most engineering/science/physics programs overlap quite a bit, and that is a great time to narrow down what you want to do.

[Likud Party Platform](http://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm)

&gt; The Jewish communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza are the realization of Zionist values. Settlement of the land is a clear expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel and constitutes an important asset in the defense of the vital interests of the State of Israel. The Likud will continue to strengthen and develop these communities and will prevent their uprooting.

And don't you go around declaring that Palestine is a state, cause Israel 'gwan kick yo ass!

&gt; A unilateral Palestinian declaration of the establishment of a Palestinian state will constitute a fundamental and substantive violation of the agreements with the State of Israel and the scuttling of the Oslo and Wye accords. The government will adopt immediate stringent measures in the event of such a declaration.

&gt; Colonialist? 

Yes.  They're creating colonies (settlements) in what you just said is another state.

&gt; Did they invade and declare that land as their own.

Yes.  See above.  Golan was formally annexed, even.

&gt; or did they take the ground now known as Palestine in an act of defence against Invasion?

Israel invaded.   Egypt was acting bellicose, but Rabin subsequently admitted they could not have invaded.   Moshe Dayan [said](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/11/world/general-s-words-shed-a-new-light-on-the-golan.html?pagewanted=all) that Israel grabbed the Golan for the farmland after creating deliberate provocations on Syrian front.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","The entire point they were trying to make is since motion controls are ""hip"" now, more and more games are trying to shoehorn them into their game when they don't even belong.

Think of how many core Wii titles have motion control aspects when it provides nothing to the game. I sure as hell didn't need Twilight Princess to force me to waggle the controller every time I wanted to swing my sword. Smash Bros. Brawl having you execute smash attacks by wiggling the wiimote actually detracted from the rest of the controls (thank god they let you disable it and use a gamecube controller). In Super Mario Galaxy shaking the controller to spin was beyond pointless. I could go on, but you see where I'm going; each of those games had the controls detracted because instead of a simple button press you now had an inaccurate carpel tunnel inducing waggle.

Now to try and cash in on the same cow that Nintendo has, Microsoft and Sony are coming out with motion controls that do very similar things. My concern is that the publishers (in an effort to make more money) will pressure developers to put in motion control in games where they don't belong and the overall quality of games will decline with a mandatory irrelevant motion control aspect.

Sure, there are some games where motion controls work, and having an excuse to get up every now and again is fine. I worry when the quality of a game suffers from motion controls, and then publishers push to make them even more prevalent in gaming.","1270080634"

Now you regularly find $50 premiums on $1100 gold (4.5% premiums) physical. 

Yet, through all this time, its still possible to buy paper-gold at spot (or below in many cases). Now, how would it be possible that the COMEX is able to continue to sell at spot, when their supposed physical inventory has such big premiums attached? 

Its obvious that something is ""not right"" with the market. Look for the great disconnect to happen eventually. At some point, the ""spot price"" will *have* to stop being the London/NY paper market and become the real physical market. Its becoming increasingly clear that those ""paper markets"" are fantasies....a magical place where you can buy gold at 5% under the ""real world"".

A supporting independent group would not be able to collectively agree with everything that the government has been doing and would have to have answers to all kinds of issues and would have a moving target on what the government has had to do and what the opposition has been throwing around... sh-t in the fan.

What does the Tea Party stand for? Primarily Tea Party members want a better economy and more jobs, but they also want all kinds of other things that may or may not have special interests behind them. Some may contradict each other and some may be impossible to implement without starting the country over.

My idea for starting the country over is to try to split it into hundreds of smaller countries or something... This way each small country could better tend to the people in it and people could know each other and trust each other and better prioritize policies... This would also make people more reliant on people from other ""countries"" so there was a greater sense of working with people from different cultures and stuff... :-)

Europe is a template for that, but Europe has got some big countries that could be split into smaller ones for instance. :-)

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; If by object-extentions you mean things Objective-C and C++

No, these are languages. There are object-extensions that can be used with a plain C compiler.

&gt; pretty much all Mac OS X applications ... in Objective C

Which is not true. All the FreeBSD and Mach stuff is not written in Objective-C. Many software just uses an adapter to Objective-C, but runs much of their stuff in their own language or in just plain C. I just got a new version of EyeTV and I'm pretty sure that their new 64bit MPEG2 decoder is not written in Objective-C. For much stuff just the UI parts are written in Objective C.

&gt; Object-based programming (cleanly combine class-based and prototype-based programming – best of both worlds with none of the bad parts) Predicate dispatching Pattern dispatching Mirror-based reflection (capability-based security with reflection) Per-object mixins The Agora programming language (the only language to really get encapsulation right – ""The Scheme of Object-oriented Programming"") Nested mixin-methods (the perfect way to handle inheritance in my opinion) Lexical inheritance Computed object-literals (eschew lambda and closures for something more general) Objects without global scope as first-class parametric modules (making ML modules look shoddy and dated) Subjective-programming (utilising context-sensitive behaviour) Seamlessly distributed object-oriented languages like Obliq Pattern-matching which respects encapsulation Specialisation interfaces (the possibility of optional type-inference for most any object-oriented language, even the dynamic ones). The integration of Actors and Objects, so programmers can easily write programs in ad-hoc network environments. ...

Wait, wait. Weren't we talking about mind-blowing recent stuff?

Agora and Obliq have been abandoned more than a decade ago, haven't they?. I have never seen any useful software written in it. Stuff like Predicate Dispatch is also more than a decade old and I'm pretty sure it existed before that somewhere in the Prolog community.

Is there anything really exciting new in the OO world that is of practical use? Used by somebody?

MechAssault 2: Lone Wolf: another classic x box game that was essentially GTA with Mechs, and the XBL play for this game was just amazing, a great title.

C&amp;C Renegade, looking back it wasn't all that great of a game by today's standards, I got this game when it was new and for the next few months i said buh bye to my social life and sleep, and hello to mammoth tanks and stealth tanks as my clan and I raped bases, good times, good times!

Any claim to the contrary is from a Naci Mocan study covering 1970's-97, in which claims every execution deters eighteen murders. But the study is incredibly shoddy.  Mocan refuses to comment on new empirical data that clearly shows otherwise, and prominent researches have dis-proven Mocan's research as highly susceptible to error and guided by 'gut feeling'.  The death penalty is no more a deterrent than life in prison, and has been a firm standing for criminologists all around the world.

That's not necessarily true. In a perfect free market, where there is viable competition that does not harm customers and the harm to customers is well known and documented, this is the case. However, we don't live in a perfect world. It's very easy for a company to suppress, lie, or hide information that the consumer needs to make a proper decision in a capitalist society. In fact, it's quite common because it helps them make more money, and that's their job. It's the sole reason that they exist. To make money.

Even if what you said *was* true, it wouldn't do anything about harm to third party persons from spillover (or externalities, collateral damage, etc). For example, person A buys product from person B, and enjoys it thoroughly. Person B realizes that he can make a larger profit by dumping waste in a nearby river and letting it flow downstream instead of paying for proper shipping and safe dumping. Downstream is a town that depends on the river for it's livelihood; from fishing, to recreation, to transport, to shipbuilding, to water. Many of these are destroyed, and others hampered, simply because there was no proper enforcement of regulations (or because regulations did not exist), and the company was acting as it was designed to in a capitalist economy. It made a profit. That is all that matters in the end.","1270080892"

But as OP said, ""you have to want to.""  Just like hypnosis isn't mind control (you can't make someone do something under hypnosis, they wouldn't be willing to otherwise), quitting smoking has to start with a true desire to want to.

In my hypnosis dealings, the difference between a successful outcome and a failure is ""oh, I'd love to try that, I want to quit so bad,"" and ""naw, that'd never work on me.""  (I'd never touch the latter group any more.)  It's all about the desire to quit, and belief you can.  

(Hypnosis can help speed that along, reinforce it, and help avoid setbacks; but it has to come from a sincere desire.)

And again, as OP said, sometimes it can be as simple as to ""just don't do that every day.""  It gets a lot easier.","1270080930"

If the HTML you are processing is well formed (in this case it is not) you can use the python lxml library. With lxml you can use XPath to select the elements/data you want.

"webcomics","t5_2qh2w","Hey dude,

First of all, thank you for sending a well-articulated and well-meant message.  I typically respond with my arrogant ass comments to people who say just, ""You're not funny,"" or ""tl;dr, shit sucks.""  I don't even know who ""tl;dr"" is, but he's probably a nice guy and doesn't deserve that.  Point is, I shouldn't waste time responding to people who already hate my comic and can't form sentences.  You're different, so I'll give you a minute.

I respect your advice about contributing to Reddit in ways outside of my own promotion.  I wish I could, as I know Reddit users would like to think it's not built as a source of advertising (it is).  But, to be honest with you man, I don't spend a lot of time surfing the internet.  I wouldn't be able to contribute much other than what content is my own anyway, and most of the stuff I do surf across, it's already been posted.  Thing is, a LOT of people, many people better than me use Reddit to promote their own crap.  They just might be a little more coy about it.  I'm terrible at self promotion, as you might have figured out.

In terms of ""a comic no one likes"", this is where I turn you off.  This comic is a hobby for me, I do it for no pay (that ad does nothing, trust me), and believe it or not, there are a few people who find it funny.  Namely myself.  Saying something ""isn't funny"" isn't a valid enough argument against its existence when the counter-argument is ""well, I think it's funny"".  That argument goes no-where.

This is my sense of humor, dude.  It's either your thing or not.  When I do surf Reddit to find other webcomics, I see tons I like and tons I think are absolute garbage.  But I've been reading and drawing webcomics for long enough to know that the internet is a very big place and open to all kinds of senses of humor.

Keep voting it down all you want.  But I'm going to be back here tomorrow with another comic, and the next day and the next, and I hope one day you'll find me funny, like you did today.

When you do a daily comic that you make every morning right as you wake up, you're not going to hit gold every day.  I've made a lot of crappy comics, but there's some gems in there.

And for the record, today's comic has as much point as all my others.  Today's just made fun of a video game.  Which scores points on the internet for some reason.","1270080956"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Omg I think we have the same [ex-?]friend. I knew a girl in college who would bring up how she was 'raped and dumped in a ditch"" the first time she met anyone new and got to talk to them for more than 10 minutes. Stupid me, I thought she just needed someone to talk to and doomed myself to a year of being her therapist. MISTAKE.

**edit, oh god, here comes the word vomit...:** I feel the need to add that she turned out to be a TOTAL bitch and attention whore. Dear god, I _tried_ to be her friend sooo hard, but she was so miserable. I had to listen to every detail of everything that had ever gone bad in her life, and while there was some super fucked up stuff (abuse, etc), it was debatable how much was even true. She had a tattoo that she said was for her ""brother who died,"" but we later found out it was actually that her mom had had a miscarriage before this girl was even born. That's right, she never even met him, but she played it like he was one of those kids that got in a motorcycle accident in High School or something. And she would claim guys raped her when she just got drunk and regretted it in the morning. She also couldn't stand it when the conversation wasn't about and/or directly involving her for more than five minutes and would throw fits about it and make snide comments when we would hang out with other people in a group. I could go on forever.

But what really sealed the deal for me was how I had to walk on eggshells to make sure I never offended her by mentioning anything in my life that was better than hers, even though my life at the time wasn't great. She brushed off my depression. Couldn't talk about my weight. Couldn't mention my boyfriend, even though he was out of the country for months. Unfortunately, my mom had recently died and she didn't feel the need to return the favor and talked to me constantly about how awesome her mom was and how they hung out all the time and had so much fun together, things that I never got to do because she died when I was 18 and thus _will never get to do_. BITCH.

*phew* Ok, I feel better.

ps: She was fat.

**edit 2:** Ok now I feel bad for bitching about this girl so hard. I really did try to be a good friend and help her out, but a girl with her own problems can only handle so much. She was in therapy for years and years and I think it really messed her up; she was completely incapable of taking responsibility for herself and would always play the victim card because (I assume) no one ever called her out on it. And of course, how do you ever begin to improve yourself if you are always blaming others for your problems? I really do hope she figures her shit out one day, because there _was_ a good person under all her bullshit, but FUCK, unless you are a glutton for punishment, if you ever run into a girl like this LISTEN TO THOSE ALARM BELLS IN YOUR HEAD WHEN SHE MENTIONS SHE WAS RAPED THE FIRST TIME YOU MEET HER.","1270080964"

No actual guarantees

Fannie Mae receives no direct government funding or backing; Fannie Mae securities carry no government guarantee of being repaid. This is explicitly stated in the law that authorizes GSEs, on the securities themselves, and in many public communications issued by Fannie Mae.

Neither the certificates nor payments of principal and interest on the certificates are guaranteed by the United States government. The certificates do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than Fannie Mae.

The perception of government guarantees has allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to save billions in borrowing costs. Estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Treasury Department put the figure at about $2 billion per year.[26]
[edit] Assumed guarantees

There is a wide belief that FNMA securities are backed by some sort of implied federal guarantee, and a majority of investors believe that the government would prevent a disastrous default. Vernon L. Smith, 2002 Nobel Laureate in economics, has called FHLMC and FNMA ""implicitly taxpayer-backed agencies"".[27] The Economist has referred to ""the implicit government guarantee""[28] of FHLMC and FNMA. In testimony before the House and Senate Banking Committee in 2004, Alan Greenspan expressed the belief that Fannie Mae's (weak) financial position was the result of markets believing that the U.S. Government would never allow Fannie Mae (or Freddie Mac) to fail.[29]","1270081073"

I mean, there's an infinite - and uncountable - number of points arbitrarily close to any point you want, even in 1 dimension.

In a rigorous way, you define a ""basis"" vector, which points to this direction, and any point can be reached by multiplying this vector by a coordinate (positive or negative).

My reasoning is that because of relativity, time slows down as you approach the speed of light, but since the Earth isn't traveling at the speed of light it wouldn't slow down. So in an infinitely small space of time (as it would seem to anyone on board the ship), tens, hundreds, or millions of years could pass.

 * The debt was only paid of because many assets has been sold. The key one being Telstra which has turned out to be a huge disaster for the country. Telstra has impeded competition at every step and has been and will be an unacceptable burden on the ability of this country to have decent internet services in the future.
 * The overall taxation of the Australian people has increased markedly due to the GST. It is not some minor tax.
 * Interest rates are set by the Reserve Bank of Australia which is independent. And due to fiscal policy lags by the government it would be difficult to know who to blame for particular increases.
 * The economic success of the Howard government was primarily due to the various mining booms that were going on brought on by China and the introduction of the GST. Generally they were terrible. Often recklessly promising major, expensive policies in the weeks before the election. Howard himself was a dreadful treasurer under the Fraser government and it showed every time he overrode Costello's decisions.
 * Work choices was a disgraceful piece of legislation. Anything that forces children and the disadvantaged to negotiate individual contracts with their employees (where they have zero bargaining power) is unacceptable. Not to mention those contracts meant you could pay below the minimum wage. Disgraceful and completely unnecessary for such a small population.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; For any given problem, one of your two assumptions is true and the other is false.

That point of view simply doesn't work in the real world where requirements can change drastically in a very short time, where you're not the only one working on the project, and often don't have access to the source code for the libraries you're using.

To go back to our earlier example, if your evaluator were part of a library people expect to be able to extend it, and you have no control over what they choose to extend it with, so you need a solution to handle conflicting cases ahead of time.

This is part of the problem specification.

&gt; A solution to a problem that cannot arise.

Yet this problem arrises constantly, and is the primary motivation behind the polymorphic approach, as advocated in the video, which you didn't watch.

Optimism is fine until it bites you in the ass; assuming that this can't happen when users are free to extend your patterns is just dangerous.

Even the paper you linked me to accepted that ""support for code reuse [is what] has object-oriented languages are popular"", then goes on to describe a [rather poor] solution for making functional languages better in this respect.

The paper you linked me to acknowledges that object-oriented programming is better for code reuse! And this is true because object-oriented programming supports unanticipated extension particularly well.

&gt; I'm saying Mathematica is a term rewriter.

You can't use that as an argument to imply that since Mathematica is extensible any solution written using pattern matching must be also.

If you weren't trying to say that  then it's irrelevant, like most of what you write.

Note: You've provided no evidence that Mathematica itself is actually extensible. You've mentioned that the bottom up lookup ordering in Mathematica helps, but I've shown that there are major problems with this approach too... in particular, having to reimplement a potentially large number of cases just to make a tiny extension, like adding a case [1].

&gt; All of the code we've seen in this thread contradicts that conclusion.

You have to understand it to draw accurate conclusions. It's really no surprise that someone who up until two days ago thought all object-oriented languages had overly strict nominal typing, classes, and an incredibly verbose syntax can't see how the solution written in a language he's never seen, using techniques he's never even heard of, has better support for unanticipated extensible.

And if you're incapable of understanding the arguments being made there's no way you'll ever learn, so there's not much point continuing.

[1] Hell, you still can't see how pattern matching limits unanticipated extension, and you've failed to solve either of the problems that I outlined to demonstrate this.

Edit: If you can't solve these problems you have no choice but to concede that your pattern matching solution has serious issues with respect to [unanticipated] extension, and given that the object-oriented solution doesn't – You lose.

Thing is that eventually the compounding of those ""manipulations"" becomes blatant. It's hard to see a 1% or 2% difference over a short time span, but compound that on a continual basis over a period of decades and eventually the discrepancies (such as are shown in the house pricing) become so large that they can no longer be ignored.

In many senses, this is what happened to the dollar under the Bretton Woods agreement -- the US was inflating all along (and at an accelerating rate) -- until eventually the discrepancy between the real value and the ""book"" value became so great that SOMEONE was not only going to notice but it was going to become too tempting not to act on (France being the key ""actor"") ... hence the [""balance of payments crisis"" problems of the 1960's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system#U.S._balance_of_payments_crisis) (and the suspension of convertibility from dollars into gold -- first for private foreign holders in 1968, and then eventually severing gold convertibility completely with the [""Nixon Shock"" in mid August of 1971](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_Shock) ).

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","There has not been an initiative to organize into a union in over ten years in any of the stores or facilities, ever since executive leadership became more active and engaged in ensuring that standards related to team member happiness were kept high at the regional and store level.  You see, that's the downside to autonomy: people may diverge from the core values of the company if their leadership isn't strong. That's what happened at Madison. All this was after one of WF's major growth spurts, and it took a bit of learning to figure out how to integrate the WF approach in a much larger organization. Growth is much more measured these days, and there's an infrastructure in place whereby team members as far-flung as Hawaii and the UK can still be active and engaged and part of the WF community.

Every now and then someone may come along and propose the idea to organize to other colleagues, but there is never even close to enough interest. Just look at the article comments in your links you included above. The comments from team members were 2-1 positive about their Whole Foods experience. Considering people are more motivated to complain than be complimentary, this is quite notable and demonstrates that a significant majority have no interest in unionizing.

I would even say from my own experience that those who do are so much of an exception that we can make the statement that Whole Foods team members do not want to unionize.

You keep talking about how I come from ""corporate"" and therefore can't represent the team members in the stores. WF is not ivory tower like that. We work hard not to be. The flagship store is on-site where the corporate offices are, and I was in the store every day. In my role I talked with store team members across the country daily and helped them resolve system issues. I included store team members in my weekly meetings and got their feedback on how to improve our systems and processes. I worked in the stores several times a year during busy times: bagging groceries, dusting wine bottles, updating shelf tags, stocking the freezer cases, setting up endcaps, collecting handbaskets, etc. I worked Christmas and Thanksgiving, because team members worked those holidays, and our paid time off plan was the same as theirs. Most of the folks around me in the HQ office started in the stores -- and this was in IT. I'm sure in other departments even more started out in the stores. It's rare to be hired externally like I was. My director (boss' boss) was part of the original group of team members at the original Whole Foods that started over 20 years ago. He's a pretty amazing, special guy who we all admire and respect greatly.","1270081230"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","This is an important and difficult ethical question, regardless of what many others here are saying.

Let me begin by saying that I pretty strongly believe that woman's right to control her body and her life trump an embryo's ""right"" to exist.  Clearly an embryo is alive in the sense that a bacterial cell is alive.  Both require specific conditions (nutrients, oxygen, water, temperature etc) to continue living, but both are alive.  However, I do not feel that simply living bestows upon them the right to continue living if a fully developed human life is put at risk (either physically, psychologically or in some other way).  The embryo has made no conscious ""investment"" it it's life, as the mother clearly has.  An embryo is simply a conglomeration of cells undergoing biochemical reactions.  It is not capable of experiencing pain.  If we could determine the point in development at which a human fetus includes the neural network that gives the perception of pain, I feel that this would be an ethical point worth adding to the equation.  I'm not saying that I would then bestow upon that fetus the status of full human rights, and probably the mothers choice would still trump the fetus - but it would still be worth noting.

In any case, I hope you get some well-considered answers here.  It is a very complex and difficult topic which is the reason it's still so controversial.","1270081287"

That's different. Your dog's moral nature is its own; you've just imposed arbitrary restrictions on it. In the case of god and man, scripture tells us that our moral nature is literally derived from god's; ie, our moral intuition is merely part of god's moral intuition. (Also, for the 'same rule to apply' to you, you'd have to *not* shit on the carpet, so I don't really get what you're going for there.)

&gt;Are you trying to argue that it is our innate morality that contradicts God's benevolence? If so, it is evidenced well enough that religious people can teach themselves against standard issue morality and if that's what their holy book is teaching, then that is the their standard.

OK. This is the kind of stuff I'm talking about. This sentence is almost impossible to parse. I want you to see the kind of work I have to do before I can understand what you're saying:

&gt;Are you trying to argue that it is our innate morality that contradicts God's benevolence?

*Benevolence and morality mean two entirely different things. So I'm substituting 'morality' because benevolence makes little sense in this context. Next, we have a hypothetical:*

&gt;If [our innate morality contradicts god's morality], then it is evidenced well enough that religious people can teach themselves against standard issue morality

*Standard issue morality? Do you mean god's morality? There are a couple of different possibilities, actually, but let's just go with that. Also we'll lose the unnecessary language.*

&gt;If [our innate morality contradicts god's morality], then religious people can teach themselves against [god's morality]

*What does it mean to 'teach yourself against x?' I'm going to assume you mean that they can teach themselves something contrary to x. The other possibility is that they can teach themselves something (not necessarily contrary) in spite of x, but that doesn't seem right. To make this even clearer I'm going to remove 'teach themselves' altogether and substitute 'have moral intuitions.'*

&gt;If [our innate morality contradicts god's morality], then religious people can [have moral intuitions] [that conflict with] [god's morality].

*So far I've ended up with a tautology. While technically true, it's not really an argument yet. Next up:*

&gt;If [our innate morality contradicts god's morality], then religious people can [have moral intuitions] [that conflict with] [god's morality]. And if that's what their holy book is teaching, then that is the their standard.

*WHAT is their holy book is teaching? It's not clear. God's morality? Or their conflicting morality? I'll assume the conflicting morality just to see where it goes:*

&gt;If [our innate morality contradicts god's morality], then religious people can [have moral intuitions] [that conflict with] [god's morality]. And if their holy book is teaching [morality that conflicts with god's morality,] then that is the their standard.

*You clearly mean to convey something significant by 'standard' but it's not coming through. Let me see if this makes more sense if I substitute 'god's morality' instead.*

If [our innate morality contradicts god's morality], then religious people can [have moral intuitions] [that conflict with] [god's morality]. And if their holy book is teaching [god's morality,] then that is the their standard.

*OK, this has officially fallen apart. I'm giving up. I don't get your point.*

See what I mean? I can *sense* what your point is, dimly, but the language you use to express it obscures it almost completely.

&gt;karma is much more a popularity of opinion

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","It looks to be from http://www.project-reason.org/scripture_project/ based on teh credit given at the bottom. For some reason Okular (KDEs PDF reader really struggled with the file) and this was all I could glean from it.

I decided to check out one of the projects listed ""contradictions"" at random: The apparently contrary verses are [Matthew 18:3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18&amp;version=NIV), vis:

&gt;*2He called a little child and had him stand among them. 3And he said: ""I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 4Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.*

and

[1 Corinthians 13:11](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+13&amp;version=NIV)

&gt;*8Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. 11When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. 12Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.*

These above are including surrounding text and are from NIV. Remember verse and chapter separations are not part of the original text so reading context of any verse is always important (as is comparison with other verses to be sure of the depth of meaning).

These verse according to Project Reason contradict as according to them one says ""Yes, it is good to be childish."" and the other ""No, it is not good to be childish."".

In fact the first clearly says that being humble like a child is good and the other is a record of the writers life giving no particular instruction it is comparing the move from this life to the next with the transition from childhood into adulthood. Contradiction fail.

I'm sure some of the examples are good, but this didn't exactly bode well for me...","1270081347"

Same with Twilight Princess; swinging the sword felt cool and natural after a while. Even games where I expected the motion controls to be cheesy like Cooking Mama and Warioware were fun.

That isn't to say there aren't games where the motion controls are sometimes terribly devised. There's still plenty of time to perfect the use of motion control in video games.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Another issue with the reluctance to drill offshore leases is rooted in simple finance--it's relatively cheap to keep the leases but extremely expensive to drill and produce the prospects.

While there has always been a push to find unorthodox oil &amp; gas assets, the latest drive in off-shore development has really redefined what deep-water is. With fields like Chevron's Jack St. Malo (8000 m+) or Petrobras's Tupi Field, the term ""deep-water"" really doesn't apply and even ""ultra-deep water"" is starting to wear out. I suppose ""Omega deep water"" could be appropriate but I'd worry about a Final Fantasy boss waiting down there.

 [Maybe there is some truth to that](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ48W6xi5YA)

Unlike terrestrial rigs where you can get real-time measurements and intervention, you can't say the same about these deep water rigs. Most use hydraulics to actuate the subsea manifolds and the ones that utilize umbilicals have their own set of problems. I know that a few companies have toyed with the idea of wireless power stations or reactors on the sea floor. The technology involved with some of these deep-water projects is really analogous to NASA. 

However they don't come cheap. 


Like doesn't_get_it said, Transocean and other rig companies are maxed out and don't have many available drill-ships. Cameron and other manufactures already have back-orders for maniflods, PLETS and other equipment. Some of the heavy lifting ships can easily average a million a day and if you ever have a problem down hole, it might take you a few weeks, a ROV or two and a few more million to diagnose the problem. 

Besides the capital investment, when things go wrong off shore regardless of how [crazy](http://abduh137.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/chevron-typhoon-after-rita.jpg) they might be--they'll be expensive. Most of the big operators can't really justify the investment in these fields unless they have huge outputs (like BP Thunderhorse). Going back to doesnt_get_it's post, the oil companies know that oil is a finite commodity and while there are still many untapped reserves in the ocean, it simply isn't economical *right* now to develop them. Most companies rather keep the cheap leases (a few million dollars) and wait until oil prices soar to develop the infrastructure when they can make a killing.

tldr: Off-shore exploration and production is damn expensive. Keeping leases, stimulating current assets and waiting for oil prices to go up is a more common strategy. ","1270081448"

Can any consumer walk into any consumer car dealer and buy a brand new 2010 convertible car without the folding roof? NO! It's not an option and therefore not optional. YOU'RE WRONG!

You said that the iPad ""was exactly what people were waiting to see since the first time they had heard the word 'tablet.'"" and YOU'RE WRONG. Again, see Dan Lyons' reaction!

The term ""slate computer"" has been used to describe a non-convertible tablet for almost a decade. The first Slate pc was the award winning Compaq TC1000 series that came out back in 2003. YOU'RE WRONG! LOOK IT UP! I'm not the one insisting on the use of this term, the entire industry has been using it for years and still uses it. Is HP's newest one-piece tablet pc called the ""HP Tablet""? NO, It's called the ""HP SLATE"" and now you know why.

You have NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE FUCKING TALKING ABOUT. You keep trying to argue and it's pissing me off! DO SOME RESEARCH AND THEN TALK TO ME!

The iPad is a stupid device that doesn't help raise the IQ of the status quo. It doesn't encourage people to truly innovate because it's a hostile and restricted platform.

It's a fucking Walmart (or a PG-rated Spencer's) and it does nothing of benefit. That's why it's DUMB.

While you may be a developer just looking to make some stupid app that will make you a few bucks and that's it. There's no challenge to that and you're lazy for wanting that out of life.

Also, developing for the Apple platform is just plain moronic. They've already shown that it could take forever and a half to get your App approved and they'll pull your app if the wind blows the wrong way. HOSTILE TO DEVS. THIS BAD CAPITALISM ON APPLE'S PART!

"business","t5_2qgzg","&gt; I don't even know what would be a useful definition of ""absolute value"".

Houses sold for X in 1996.  They now sell for 2X.  The absolute value has doubled.

Compare that to:  A monthly house payment in 1996 was Y, which was a fraction F of monthly income I.  Now, F is bigger, because the other parts have shrunk. 

The latter is what you said.

&gt; If people have twice as much ""absolute value money"" available*, and compete for roughly as many accommodation, I expect them to spend twice as much to secure their accommodation.

Then why didn't many other items also double?

The real reason:  There wasn't a housing bubble, there was a *credit* bubble.  Many people took on debt that they couldn't handle when economic stress arrived, as it always does.  And those folks competed against one another.

The reason that everything didn't rise in price?  The silly credit would only be extended for housing.","1270081585"

They might not be as fast as they could be with vi, but my argument is that the percentage increase they would get in putting in the time to practice with vi isn't worth the time and brainpower it takes.  This might not be the case if you're using a text editor *extremely* often, but I'd guess that the people who do represent a relatively small percentage of all text editor users, just like people who use calculators or abacuses *all the time* are a relatively small percentage of all people who might sometimes use one.","1270081594"

If you're doing some sort of math that looks like it's spewing out (_in_ SR) a preferred frame (the one in which a special distinguished vector is the pure time direction), that would seem like something is going wrong. And, well, as I said, I'm very uncomfortable with this eigenvalue problem given that one side is a vector, the other a one-form.

Or are we talking about different things? ie, did I misunderstand and you mean some matrix other than the matrix of the components of the metric tensor?

Since if you mean the components of the metric tensor, then it does depend on reference frame. In one frame, specifically a frame in which a  particular timelike vector is the time basis vector, that vector is an ""eigenvector"" of the matrix in question. In a reference frame in which the components of that vector are (5/3, 4/3, 0, 0), it is not an eigenvector.

I've yet to find a single demo on the web that shows you're more productive in vim at things like refactoring, code browsing and documentation generation, things that developpers do several times per minutes. There are plenty of extensions, all of them always break the vim ""workflow"" and they just don't fit in naturally - at least in my coding style.

For example, variable renaming. I simply can't see how it's more productive to type :%s/\&lt;myFun\&gt;/myOtherFun/g than a single select and alt-shift-r in pydev (not to mention the vim search and replace will only work on your current buffer, not your whole workspace). They are tons of other examples. 

Text editing facilities in some IDE are often vastly underrated. The number of people that don't try to customize them or learn the keyboard shortcuts is astounding - And that helps to continue the myth you're much slower with them.

Finally if you add the fact that 10% of the development time of a project is actually spent typing code (most the of rest is communication and modelling)...

i definitely view dressing as an artistic form of self expression, but i don't dress to get attention.  my wardrobe is mostly vintage 70's clothing, about half designer and half inexpensive department store polyester.  the new things i buy tend to be high end luxury and custom bespoke items.  i justify the expense by buying only extremely well made and durable things that are built to last generations.  hopefully, my son will be my size.  i have some really nice things from my father that fit perfectly.  i don't buy cheap disposable things, they tend to cost more in the long run.  i usually only wear colors, not much black, gray, or white.  nothing too bright though, i like earth tones.  i love comfortable fabrics like cashmere, moleskin, and velvet.  i also love itchy harris tweed.

i do have to give some credit to the way i dress for my success in attracting women that i find attractive.  they know right away that i'm an unconventional vain weirdo and that's who i'm looking for too.  if they are looking for a straight-laced conformist they know to stay away and no one's time is wasted.

i think the celebrity i dress most similar to is wes anderson.  although i dressed this way before he was famous, so maybe he's copying me.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm not a girl, but I'll shoot... the best response I've ever gotten from approaching a stranger was at the Tonic Bar in Times Square, NYC. I was there interviewing for a job, and I was engaged at the time. A gorgeous redhead (I'm a sucker for a redhead), and her friend came and sat beside me at the bar. I turn to the redhead, and back to the bartender and say just loud enough for her to hear, ""Isn't that the most gorgeous shade of red you've ever seen in a woman's hair?"". She turned, blushed, said thank you, and started talking to me. 

Two months later my engagement broke up. I wish I still had a chance to hook up with that NYU student now.

A couple of notes: 

1) I'm not terribly attractive... ( http://hphotos-snc1.fbcdn.net/hs146.snc1/5440_702142388979_11828211_40159743_3461955_n.jpg )

2) I'm completely convinced the reason this worked is because it was non-threatening. Because I was just wanting to do some harmless flirting, and knew it couldn't go anywhere, I was more cavalier, less nervous, and maybe less pushy than I would usually be. I try to replicate this, with less success, now that I'm single again.

Those are extreme situations, but my point is:

I gave the creeped out look because I was panicked and didn't know what to do. I think that some women use it because they're mean, but I also think that a lot of women use it because they're being approached inappropriately. Culture hasn't exactly cultivated a healthy playing field for men approaching women: men aren't socialized to do it in a way that necessarily makes women comfortable, and women aren't socialized to be immediately comfortable with interacting with men in unfamiliar territory.

 Some languages are thought to be intriniscally object first, but there are constructions involving movement in English that can result in object first sentences, like passive voice:

First, abstinence. I'm no prude and I've enjoyed sex 1000's... err... tens of times. It is, however, a perfectly acceptable alternative to abortion...

But it's not one that many people are going to take. I've heard that condoms are 99.99% safe. Even if it were just 99%, if you know someone having that much sex please tell them to send me some tips. Learning how to use a condom and taking advantage of that knowledge in every sexual encounter is a great way to avoid not only unwanted pregnancies, but also STDs. 

Finally, if all else fails, there is the option of getting the morning after pill. That can work up to 72 hours after intercourse. 

If these options were not available, I probably wouldn't call abortion selfish and irresponsible- but they are available. Barring some of the extreme circumstances we've talked about here in other comments, someone would have to ignore all of these options to be left with only abortion as means of escaping an unwanted pregnancy.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Three gripes:

1. Controlled character dies = game over. What the fuck. This bothers me about the persona games as well, but it's even worse here because there's no ""main protagonist"". Arbitrary member of your group keels over, even if you have 99 revive items in your bag, the game flashes to game over screen. Bad design.

2. Every battle in the game has the exact same flow. Plink plink plink until stagger, L1 -&gt; ATK/BLA/BLA, press X X X X X for 20 seconds, repeat. It required me playing WoW to see how utterly *boring* the design of encounters in most games are. Hate on WoW if you like, but you have to respect that they actually sat down their design people and burned significant calories on thinking about ""okay, what would be a cool twist to add to an encounter?"" or ""how can we iterate an existing encounter to get something more interesting?"" By contrast, the S-E designers seemed to be more focused on visual design, like ""woah, what he had a fucking FOOT instead of an eye, and he was actually like, a giant floating clock that constantly dripped blood.""

3. I've had this beef with every FF battle system labeled ""ATB"". There is this completely arbitrary lag between the time you decided to input your command and when your command actually executes. You've already waited 10 seconds for that fucking bar to fill up, now you randomly wait another 1~10 seconds while lightning slowly paces back and forth in her ready animation. It's not like the enemies are attacking during this time period, either. It's just... dead air. Oh, and the part where it takes her 5 seconds to run over, 1/4 of a second to slash, and 5 more seconds to run back is awesome. To me, it feels the same as playing an online game with ~400 ping.

False. The idea here is to make a game that is fun for *everyone*, not a game that is only fun for a couple hundred Korean guys. Pro gaming is always self balancing anyway, as the players are skilled enough to be able to exploit and counter-exploit all the strategies of the game far more effectively than regular gamers. And when you start with a game that is already this incredibly balanced, there will be very few ""exploits"" that even work. ","1270081826"

i suck at being articulate but what i meant to say was that, i just generally avoid attractive people because i have no self confidence. i also feel that i have much more pressure to stand out or something, since i dont have looks going for me. its just much easier to talk to someone ""on my level"" at least in terms of hotness or attractiveness. i can be myself and generally enjoy conversing so much more.

i guess what im saying is that i might find someone attractive in the library but i'd rather approach someone who's not as hot. im not all that attractive and it jsut seems like its a lot more complicated and risky to approach someone who's hot. it might be a result of a fear of being rejected or getting hurt. but i'd rather be myself with someone who doesn't freak me out than try to approach someone very easily might just think im a creep before even giving me a chance just because of looks.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; commands are so expressive that it has a significative impact on your cognitive load

Listen: While I am typing letters and symbols into a computer, my brain is empty. I *think* that I am thinking while I am typing this to you, but it's simply not true. It is only after I have finished typing that I *remember* thinking it while I was typing.

It's because of that that powerful editing commands yield a net improvement.

Consider the mental command is: *move this word here over there*

So you decide to forgo the cognitive load, and start mashing *shift+control+right, control+x, control+right-arrow-right-arrow-right-arrow-right-arrow-right-arrow-right-arrow-right-arrow-right-arrow-right-arrow, left-arrow, control-v*. While you were doing that, you didn't think about programming at all. Now you have to start thinking about programming again.

Meanwhile I thought about programming, said `dwf0P` and went back to programming. If perhaps it took me slightly longer to translate the mental command into that, I certainly didn't notice, but I *did* notice that you were still pushing those arrow keys when I started programming again. Furthermore, since I stopped programming for less time, getting back into the flow of things was easier.

&gt; I don't think that i am so ""absorbed"" when using automatic refactor tools in other higher-level IDEs.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","The use of the word 'reserve' is an artefact from a gold standard era. The Reserve Bank of Australia refers to them as 'exchange settlements' and the accounts that banks have at the RBA ""exchange settlement accounts'. 

Furthermore reserves do not constrain bank lending, as central banks will accommodate any demand for reserves, as the RBA states:

&gt;“The Reserve Bank has no prescribed target for the level of settlement balances, supplying whatever amount is needed to keep the cash rate near the target” (RBA, 2003, p.4)

This is because, the firstly, the transactions between the government and the private sector, that is, inflow of taxes and government spending, has huge ramifications for the amount of exchange settlements. This effect is known as the 'reserve effect' or 'exchange settlement effect'. Secondly, because bank credit creation is always endogenous; loans create deposits, banks require a clearing house in which their debts to each other can be settled. Due to institutional arrangements banks are required to settle each night. This means that the banks are highly interest inelastic. Without the central bank putting a ceiling on overnight rates and supply the necessary amount, the overnight rate will become extremely volatile and fluctuate on a daily basis. 

re reserve ratio. Only a few countries have this requirement in place, America being one. But I don't believe you are describing the actual reserve ratio in place. Firstly, only 10% of reserves are to be held against *certain* liabilities, such as demand deposits. Secondly, it is only the average number of liabilities within a two week period. What this means is that throughout the period, the actual reserve ratio may be above or below the target (generally below) and only when the bank approaches the end of period date due they begin increasing reserves up to the corresponding average of its liabilities.

 If the bank finds itself short on reserves it will engage in the following actions:
1. liability management. As mentioned before it is only certain bank liabilities which require the offsetting reserves. Banks will frequently engage in a 'sweeping off accounts', where they will change the type of liability into another type which does not require an offsetting liability. 
2. Increase inflow of deposits, by increasing the rates it pays on various forms of deposits, such as, demand deposits or timed deposits. This creates an incentive for customers to transfer their bank credit from one bank to another. The inflow of deposits means that the central bank will credit the banks exchange settlement account with the corresponding amount.
3. if the bank is still short, it will borrow from the central bank. This is the most expensive option.

I don't quite understand the following:
&gt;When a bank is loaned up and tries to pay out to a depositor, it must draw from reserves, and it decreases deposits by the same amount.

Banks cannot decrease deposits. Deposits can only decrease at the aggregate when government's surplus spend or when loans are repaid. ","1270081913"

The solution to this isn't to hide the features, it's to implement them better! You guys have programmers working for you, just design a proper GUI.

In addition to this, the lack of a strong turn-out for John McCain in 2008 hurt the Republicans.  Between the increased turn-out from the people upset with the health insurance overhaul law, the TARP funding, the stimulus spending and more, I think the Republicans will be competitive in the House, taking back between 25 and 33 seats and take 5-7 seats in the Senate.   

The trend for first Congressional elections after being newly elected doesn't bode well for President Obama either.  They won't take the House or the Senate but will dent the Democratic majorities to the point that there will have to be truly bipartisan legislation.  

Though if I had my choice, I would rather split rule, with having one body controlled by the opposition party.  I think that helped America in the late 90's and in later in the Bush presidency.

This will stop casual script kiddies/malware picking it up, and people of that nature finding it, and distributing it to porn sites.

If someone's determined then there's nothing that you can do to keep it safe if you are accessing it yourself.  It'd be possible for someone with physical access to install a rootkit/keylogger to get the password for any encryption you have, and then access have complete access.

Ultimately you need to make a decision about how much effort you want to put in to securing it.  Basically comes down to this:  It's porn, there's terabytes of free porn on the net, and I don't see it being worth the effort for a casual person to steal yours.

Also, if it's porn which is illegal where you live and you're afraid of the police finding it then  you'd be surprised at what you can find with forensics tools.

I should mention that I've got the other two, but the set up is a lot harder, you pretty much have to modify a launcher for them, it involves mounting a virtualCD before the game will let you play anything.

Kevin Rudd has a reputation in Australia for being very bland and boring, and now I guess humourless. I'm amazed that he would take it out of context and attempt to pass the ""insult"" to another group of people.

To say that Australians as a whole have no sense of humour is total bs, I love a good laugh, especially when it's self depreciating. In fact, I've always grown up being taught and believing that you HAVE to take the piss out of someone if the opportunity arises, whilst maintaining the joke in a good natured way.

Also, Robin Williams said that ""if Charles Darwin had landed in Australia..."" well as some people have already pointed out he did come to Australia, on the Beagle. 

Additionally, it is alleged that Darwin commited his thoughts against a single creator, to paper, during his passge through the Blue Mountains

http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/01/10/1136863239665.html

The interpretation of the phrase ""ordinary people"" here is admittedly context-dependent (in the original article, the first similar phrase was actually ""ordinary individuals""). And I don't know about Great Britain (where I think the article was written), but in the US of A, most daily-newspaper-context uses of a phrase like that would speak to a pretty rudimentary understanding of arithmetic, much less programming languages. I had three students in my office hours the other day, for example, who didn't know that (in the US) commas are normally used to separate groups of three digits, or how many thousands made a million. These weren't computing students, but they were ""select liberal arts college"" students. Various unkind remarks about liberal arts colleges aside, even these students would be considered by most people to be brighter and more academically inclined than ""ordinary""

So I think it's fair to say that in the context it was used, ""ordinary people"" probably doesn't include many who could even *use* ML, much less understand its various subtleties. Maybe it's different in Britain ... but I doubt it: I once envied Gordon Plotkin the sophistication of his students out loud, and he was quick to dissuade me that things were all that rosy even in Edinburgh. (This was admittedly before I added the shocking anecdote above to my repertoire.)

I certainly appreciate the sentiment of your other remark, below, about owing Milner everything: his influence on my own work and life has been considerable, and that's just counting what I can easily trace.","1270082010"

a better response would be that in a free marketplace, the power always lies with consumer choice. they've decided to change their system to make a profit and also to counter-act the acts of hackers. 

ultimately, you have the choice to stop supporting Sony financially, and maybe you do have a case for a full refund, but in the end, you don't purchase a system so much as you purchase a EULA, and that EULA you accepted when you first turned on your PS3 gives them the ability to make such changes. this is not supporting the whole EULA process, i'm just speaking of how it affects the real world now.","1270082094"

It doesn't work that way.

&gt;A number of high profile baby rapes since 2001 (including the fact that they required extensive reconstructive surgery to rebuild urinary, genital, abdominal, or tracheal systems) increased the need to address the problem socially and legally. In 2001, a 9-month-old baby was raped by six men, aged between 24 and 66, after the infant had been left unattended by her teenage mother. A 4-year-old girl died after being raped by her father. A 14-month-old girl was raped by her two uncles. In February 2002, an 8-month-old infant was reportedly gang raped by four men. One has been charged (McGreal, 2001). The infant has required extensive reconstructive surgery. The 8-month-old infant's injuries were so extensive, increased attention on prosecution has occurred.

My feeling is, as a woman, my monthly cycle is part of what makes me  a woman.  If you enjoy the other fun parts of me that make me a woman my partner should be able to enjoy me during this time as well.  It's one thing if a woman doesn't feel well on her period or if it's physically uncomfortable to have sex on her period (sometimes the cervix can sit low during this time thus making it painful to be penetrated if the male hits the cervix and that sensation is painful for the woman) but if it's a case of, ""ewwww, it's blood!"" I think men should just get the eff over it and grow the fuck up.  And if women think it's gross I think it's time to seriously take a gander at why a woman would feel their natural menses are 'gross' and not just another fucking type of thing dripping out of their 'special place' than the other 3 weeks of the month.  What's going on historically and currently that might make a woman feel that way about their periods and sexual things happening during it?  Something to think about for both genders.

Whereas food, safety products, housing, and bicycles are currently PST exempt, the HST will include these items. This will hit low-income people the hardest. Also, the government touting itself as ""green"" with the new Skytrain and carbon tax while nailing consumers on bicycles is ridiculous.

Take a look at the facts - this tax hits average and low-income folks and subsidizes businesses that have already been reaping windfall tax breaks under Campbell's neo-liberal Milton Friedman machine.","1270082195"

I haven't had any serious mental 'problems' except depression for a few years when I was younger, but now I'm so happy.  Nothing has brought me down in the past 2 years.  If my brain were to veer in that direction, that happiness is of course susceptible to harm, but still.  I might say otherwise once in your position, though :D

Stuff like this interests me on so many different levels.  How fascinating the mind is and what the mind can do.  Have you tried to draw Jennifer, or any of your other spirits?

"lost","t5_2qhag","Desmond: I can't actually explain why he is so appealing. Everything about the character just works, I guess. His personal story, his mysterious role in everything that's going on, the actor playing him. I think he's a mixture of several classic character types: the reluctant hero, ""special"" without wanting to be or knowing why; the underdog who gets beat down but finds a way to overcome; the everyman who's just kind of caught up in things and has the same reaction to it all that the audience does; there are probably more.

Ben: An awesome villain played by an awesome actor, and I just love how they have played out his character arc. It is so easy to ruin a character like that by introducing vulnerabilities, but his evolution has been spectacular to watch, and I give a lot of the credit for that to Michael Emerson.

Juliet: I didn't like her much at first, but she turned into the best female character on the show once we learned more about her. I love how internal she is, which is not something you see very often in any female written for the screen.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was working as a cash clerk at a drug store when I was about 16. It was late, near close, when an old man slowly walked up to the register. I cannot recall what he purchased but what he said has been fresh in my memory since then. As usual, I greeted him kindly and while I handed him his bag and reciept I looked him in the eyes and said 'have a nice night sir'. He grabbed his bag and hesitated, with a raspy, cracked voice he looked me dead in the eye and said 'have a nice life', turned and walked out the door. I stood motionless for a moment as I felt a shiver through my body and my hairs stand up on the back of my neck. 

It left with me a sense of dread initially, imagining myself as an old man such as himself one day. Short thereafter however I saw his comment in a different light. This man had an entire lifetime of experiences and was coming to the end of his lifetime. It was a simple gesture of reminding me of my own mortality and that I have an entire lifetime of experiences that was just beginning.

(Note: The following is what I learned in my physiology courses paired with reason, no abstracts or evidence).

Chemical (classical) receptors work via chemicals, mechanoreceptors just work by touch. I also know that Ghrelin, a hormone that signals hunger, is released from an empty stomach. It would make sense that touching the mechano-receptors would inhibit Ghrelin release. (Food in gut = signal to brain saying food is present)

A smaller stomach (as is acheived via fasting) would mean that less food is required to touch an equal amount of surface area, thus receptors. An equal amount of food would touch more receptors the smaller the stomach, and give a greater sensation of full.

It'd be foolish to refuse that support. 

And to trade 4.6% for an immensely tiny population who have chosen to educate themselves and form their own opinion, well, that's equally foolish. Not that many people understand the middle eastern crisis and those who would vote for a guy because of perceived anti-semiticism (note perceived, it doesn't have to be reality) isn't quite a group anyone would *want* voting for them.

“This is not a disagreement, but a struggle with evil incarnate, so there is no structure for a peaceful reconciliation” in which “people are cast in their roles as either enemy or friend and there is no such thing as middle ground,” Brasher explains, “In the battle with evil, can you really say you are neutral?”

The problem, then, is not Christian fundamentalism or apocalyptic belief per se but with forms of Christianity (or any religion) that condone or ignore scapegoating, fundamentalist movements that become totalitarian, or apocalypticism combined with dualistic demonization.

Where can we find this? I have a shelf of books published in the past 20 years in which right-wing fundamentalists warn of an impending apocalyptic battle pitting Godly Christians against sinful secular elites, those in favor of government social welfare programs, Muslims, New World Order internationalists seeking global cooperation, people working for peace, abortion providers, sinful homosexuals, and many more named scapegoats.

*Militias, Tea Parties, and Right-Wing Populism*

Why are there so many angry people? The Tea Parties are part of a broad Patriot Movement in the United States cobbled together from several preexisting formations on the political right:

    # Economic libertarians who worry about big government collectivist tyranny.
    # Christian Right Conservatives who oppose liberal government social policies
    # Right-wing apocalyptic Christians who fear a Satanic New World Order
    # Nebulous conspiracy theorists who fear a secular New World Order
    # Nationalistic ultra-patriots concerned that US sovereignty is eroding.
    # Xenophobic anti-immigrant white nationalists who worry about preserving the “real” America.

I asked a doctor about this once, and she said if and when the young woman changes her mind and wants to have children, it will be very difficult to almost impossible to return the ability to bear children to the woman. Doctors have apparently been sued in the past for sterilizing young women, and even if it's not politically correct to conclude that young women who don't want to have children will ""get over it"" or change their minds, it does happen.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","I get bumps and I don't even *really* shave, I only use the trimmer part of an electric shaver to take my facial hair down to stubble. (Because if I actually shave, I get about ten bumps, whereas I might just get one or two if I only trim.)

Sometimes, the bumps get infected.

This is no fun *at all.*

So, just be happy with your bumps and try to be glad you don't have to disinfect your face with surgical wash every time you shave. I am contemplating one of those Panasonic shavers that can be used in the shower, actually, so I can disinfect that and my hands and my face and shave without touching anything else that might contain bacteria, and then put a thin layer of antibiotic ointment on my whole face.

As to avoiding the bumps, my advice would be to stop shaving and just learn to rock the beard. 

I have actually had laser hair removal treatments on my face, but unfortunately I'm middle-aged and have too many gray whiskers for that to really work. The hair needs to absorb energy from the laser in order to heat up and destroy the follicle, stopping future growth. This works best with dark hair and basically not at all with white hair. 

If you are young and have dark hair and light skin, laser beard removal might be worth looking into. You will need several treatments to get it all. However, if it works, you will never even have stubble. Of course, downside is it'll look like you *can't* grow a beard.","1270082512"

seems to me that the eye-brain scans the environment constantly and forces updates only when new data is encountered; in which case the sooner the new data appears on the display the sooner your eye-brain adds the new input to the apparently constant map of the visual field, and the sooner you can react and try to dodge whatever it is that's incoming. Which to my mind explains the desire for higher frame-rates from devices and displays.

One of the few great things about Blizzard is that nothing was released early.  They release something when they felt it was ready.  Kotick probably saw the internal proposed release dates for Cataclysm, Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2 and went bat shit insane because they aren't exploiting the popularity with a short development cycle.

Starcraft is supposedly expected in 2010.  This pretty much turns it into a guaranteed 2010.  I'm betting Diablo 3 in early 2011.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Having children is a completely selfish act and is pointless. Humanity is absurd and people don't even think before they bring another human into the world- they don't even question why they are doing it- they just 'do' because its what everyone else is doing and we are supposedly 'designed' to propagate- this kind of 'default' justification dismisses any sense of higher critical thinking and consciousness that we humans 'supposedly' possess. The world is more warped and corrupt than you can imagine and yet people blindly continue to 'breed'  unaware of the increasing lack of control or influence over how their child will turn out. And for those who say 'you don't know what you're missing, you only realize how wonderful they are when you hold them in your arms the first time and see yourself in them blah blah- spare me the narcissism. If i don't know what i'm missing then i won't have any regrets- and no being afraid of growing old alone and not having anyone to take care of you etc. is not a valid enough reason to have kids- in fact it bolsters the argument that indeed it is a selfish act. We have an advanced mental faculty that is able to override the instinct to procreate and this is what separates us from savage beasts. More people should use it. The irony is that those who shouldn't be having kids (due to their parental incompetence) are propagating and those who are altruistic and have the potential to be devoted parents are abstaining. As for the argument of 'well if everyone stopped having kids then the aging population would suffer and ultimately humanity would end'- so what? THINK before you breed- if its not for you DON""T DO IT. You actually do have a choice in the matter. You're not just having a cute little baby to play with for Christmas, you are bringing an ADULT into the world, an ADULT who had no say in whether he/she wanted to be here so better make sure the conditions are favourable for them- lets try both parents being sane for starters.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","That's what I was thinking, if I could transfer across next year. The university I got accepted into doesn't do physics though. I might appeal to the university that does physics, I applied for software engineering last year and got a conditional, I am meeting the conditions this year but they have denied me this time around which is a bit annoying. Tuition is free in Scotland so due to the economic crisis a helluva lot more people have been applying for university, I'm lucky to have a place as it is. I think it is something like 40,000 more applications to the 12 universities in Scotland. 

I guess I just need to stop worrying and play it as it comes, in the western world we live such safe lives that for pretty much the first time in human history we are free to do whatever we want without a real fear of death looming over whatever we do - i don't really have a right to worry about my options. I guess another year isn't really that big a deal, I just read an article about some people simulating a trip to mars, they're going to spend 3 years in isolation just to see what it's like and note down how much it fucks them up! 

That's really cool you're doing medieval studies, I was actually seriously considering doing a similar course. I have a bit of a penchant for the days were all you needed was a good sword and shield. I'm re-reading 'a song of ice and fire' by George r r martin, have you read it? It's one of my favourite fantasy series and is loosely based on the war of the roses. 

You're right, it's better to do something you are passionate about, regardless of what money lies at the end of the tunnel. You never know what opportunity's will present them selves, what turn of the dice you will have or what hand you get dealt along the way. 

Thank you good sir, I extend the same offer to you. My next bowl is in your honour. 

Scotland is harmless although I wouldn't say the same of the people. We had wolves long ago but they were killed, people are wanting to re introduce them into the wild. the most dangerous animals we have are adders which are the only venomous snakes in the British Isles. I've never seen one though. I actually want to leave my area, I'm Scottish born and bred but I don't like living in a small community. I love the land though, I'll miss the highlands wherever I go.

Pros:

* i5 Processor - meant to be faster than the AMD for video editing etc. and has an upgrade path to some of the i7 range
* Faster hard drive, but still 1.5TB
* Faster memory - more scope for overclocking if you bother
* Higher wattage PSU
* Cheaper - could allow bump the memory up to 8Gb.

Cons:

* Case doesn't look great

Therefore, any number X can only have 2 directly neighboring points!

However, whenever you talk about what you see to be true about the origins of life, or what happens after death, you can't explain any of it without the phrase ""I believe"". 

You believe we're all descendants of stardust, and when we die we just become apart of the earth again. So circumcision makes no sense under that belief structure, because it only makes sense for you to try and experience ultimate happiness while you are alive.

In someone else's belief structure, we're creations of god, and when we die we go to heaven (if we live our life correctly), thus we are not living our life to experience ultimate happiness, we are living our life to make god happy. For those people circumcision is a rite of passage into that religion, which is a stepping stone in their path to heaven.

In the same way you don't want someone to disturb your ability to experience ultimate happiness while you are alive, THEY don't want you to tell them they can't take an important stepping stone on the path to heaven.

BTW, the use of name calling (""for the sake of superstition""), is just an example of how you are trying to abolish an opposing religion because you do not agree with it.","1270082641"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Hahaha, this is my total Damsel in Distress story.

Ok, so I'm from regional Victoria and am driving through Melbourne one time. I'm on St Kilda Rd, and am meeting my sister for lunch. I pull up in a parking spot outside a big office building and manage to run my car up the kerb - which, being in Melbourne, is not nicely rounded but a 90 degree corner. 

I'm waiting for my sister to rock up when there's this knock on my window. A lad in a suit from the office is peering in, and he asks me if I'd like a hand with changing my tyre.

I didn't even realise it, but I'd run up that gutter so hard I'd obliterated my front left tyre (I'd been driving for 4+ hours by that point, don't judge me!). 

So, I get out and give him a hand, digging out my jack and spare while he calls a mate down, and in the middle of their lunch hour they both changed my tyre for me. I offered to help, but they insisted. 

As payment, I offered them a six-pack each of Strongbow that I had in my boot, and they refused it. It was true chivalry, and I have to admit, even the raging feminist in me was impressed by how courteous and helpful they were.

It's like walking into a restaurant, complaining loudly about how ugly the decor is, making sure both the staff and other patrons can hear your thoughts about the slow, terrible wait staff that constantly drop plates, whine about how it costs too much and how it's too calorific, but still sitting there and chowing down on the meal you just ordered. All that whilst trash-talking the owner of the restaurant and his business practices.

I understand where the generalisation comes from, but it's one that applies to pretty much the whole of humanity, not just a subset of consumers who purchase games. People moan and bitch, but it's usually skin-deep. They don't *really* care about the issue they're whining about, they just enjoy having a moan. That's why they still go out and buy X and then sit online complaining.

&gt; “Extraordinary means” are all medicines, treatments, and operations, which cannot be obtained or used without excessive expense, pain, or other inconvenience, or which, if used, would not offer a reasonable hope of benefit.

Still feels ethically ambiguous to me..., mostly because 'excessive' could mean so many things - a devout pro-lifer and a devout pro-choicer could agree on this statement simply by pinning the meaning of 'excessive' and 'reasonable' at different points on the spectrum.

A Final Fantasy game could never live by the story alone. Battle system maybe (Though 13s battle system cannot carry the game, especially how it's painfully slowly introduced). The series was always the sum of it's parts, that's whats made it good. I'm not saying that every Final Fantasy game should have the exact same overworld, town structure and side missions.

Which kinda pisses me off, since we're going to run out of oil at some point either way, regardless of whether we buy it overseas or drill for it ourselves.

Can you detect outright bullshit? Probably. If you can handle material at a scientific american level and are willing to invest some time.

It helps to be a solid critical thinker / smart / etc. but really a lot of fields just take time to learn the details of. For example, I could bs you all day long in things I teach and you'd likely never know, and it would take you a LOT of work - i.e. an education in the subject - to learn how to tell. This is in fact a good teaching technique for people with a fairly solid grasp of a subject (e.g. a graduate student).

If the BS is at the level of high school or first year science then digging around at the Scientific American level / etc. will likely build you a conceptual foundation good enough to judge big arguments. But not subtle arguments. Catching subtle errors (and sometimes deceptions) is what the review process is about. If it is something so subtle that a professional could make it as a mistake, only a professional has a shot at catching it. 

This may seem pedantic. Sorry. But here's the thing.

Many of the arguments in, say, climate change research demand a very very solid understanding of the earth system as well as how systems behave (i.e. math / systems thinking / ...) as well as a really good understanding of how specific datasets were captured, validated, processed, etc. etc. etc. By the time it turns into a curve or a prediction a huge amount of 'knowledge' has gone into it. If you have that knowledge, you have a shot at detecting subtle shenanigans. If you don't, well, you don't. Looking at some temperature readings isn't going to help. You have to understand not only current climate systems but also other modes the climate CAN be in and also the possible errors in data collection / systematic bias / etc. If you can understand that stuff,  you are not an outsider / amateur.

If you simply want to be able to decipher chartjunk, read Huff and Tufte and the various other guides to finding statistical bs. But if you want to look past the numbers into whether they mean something... well, that's hard.

I for one assume that any media reports I read outside my field of expertise are likely either error filled or deliberate crap. I've seen what reporters did with interviews I gave. Reordering a sequential argument about cause and effect turns sense into nonsense. Yet they were angry at me for insisting it be fixed. Now I assume anything in the paper is probably wrong.

We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. 

But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new: an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. 

In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto, ""Anyone can cook"". But I realize only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist. But a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France.

As far as arranged marriage goes, why not compromise? Instead of your parents arranging your marriage with few questions asked, could they arrange set-ups for you instead? That way the person you are seeing (perhaps with a serious long-term mindset) is someone who they have chosen and approve of. If it works out, then great! If it doesn't send mom and dad back to the drawing board. Obviously there are many factors that would influence your ability to do something like this, mostly on the part of your parents and their feelings.

You can't just ""man up"" and get over it, you can't sleep around to forget about her, you can't stop thinking about her 1000 times a fucking day and you can't stop that sick feeling in your stomach.
BUT, that is not to say there is not hope.  This is what I did to move on with my life:

Step 1: Friends.  I found a friend to talk/cry to about all my pathetic little insecurities (if you don't have a friend you would be comfortable doing this with, I would suggest a therapist/psychologist, you have no idea how good it feels to blurt out all those little insecurities you have).  Step 2:  Laugh and be inspired:  I watched pretty much my entire DVD collection and laughed and was inspired and it is a great way to get the mind off stuff.  Step 3:  Gym.  I lost 8 kilos since my break-up.  I started hitting the gym and now I look better than I ever have.  The thing about the gym is to focus on you.  Picture each rep as bringing you closer to your goals in life.
Once you have all that shit taken care of,  you can get out there and have fun.  If you were anything like me, my social circle was almost non-existant after my break-up because my ex had become essentially my entire support network in one person.  I would suggest getting out there and starting joining some group activities.  Personally I'm not a fan of the whole dating website thing, I think the best strategy is to just arrange coffee with friends, meet friends of friends, meet up with them.  Hassle people to organise something for you to do on Friday and Saturday nights.

At the end of the day you don't need HER for your happiness.  True happiness comes from within.

Oh and one last thing:  Don't pursue that chick!  If it's meant to be it's meant to be, but for now you gotta close off all hope of ever being with her or you won't be able to move on.  Don't let her string you along either.","1270082933"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yes: I'm sure there's some portions/patches of mountains in wilderness areas that had never been touched by humans before me, due not merely to their isolation, but the difficulty in approaching/traversing particular spots. Both people and animals tend to be lazy and avoid the hard work necessary to get to certain locations. I actually sought them out at one time, for somewhat unusual reasons.


You also have to remember that the Americas were the next to last major land areas ever to be explored/settled by ancient humans (with Antarctica being the last), around 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. Tech advances didn't really allow the populations there to explode until the European colonization efforts got into high gear around 500 years ago. So the Americas likely have lots more areas still pristine to human touch than most of Europe and Asia and Africa.


I do suspect Australia beats everything but Antarctica for this honor though-- despite people first getting there maybe 50,000 to 60,000 years ago-- simply because it never did get more than sparsely populated, and so damn much of its huge interior is simply too much of a hell hole for anybody to live in.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't know how to explain this...let's see. You're making a weird assumption that vegetarians who eat fake meat are doing so only to have some reminiscence of animal meat, instead of assuming that they eat it as an alternative and easy way to transition into eating in a totally vegetarian manner. All those fake meats are created to resemble meat because it is a socially constructed way of eating...eg; there is the common practice of putting lunch meat in sandwiches, the mass popularity of beef hamburgers, and also it is practiced that people eat bacon with breakfast toast &amp; eggs, etc. Hence alternatives that resemble that meat-based style of eating.

Perhaps you should view the use of fake meat as a transition from the usual traditions of eating animal meat and toward a society in which other ways of eating become more popular. Fake meat is a transition, not merely a substitute for something (meat) that seems to be a necessity...which it isn't, because clearly there are other vegetarian proteins you can eat. Being vegetarian is a manner of how much you're individually willing to give up, I suppose, but it isn't thaaat hard for me honestly and I think my health/life is in some ways better for it.  

Anyway, the necessity of meat is a different argument altogether. If you would like to argue that, fine. But I guarantee your argument for the necessity of meat is based on your own social environment in which ""another way"" doesn't seem possible...maybe you grew up around a farm, or maybe your town or your friends eat meat all the time as a tradition, or *whatever* it is that has created your point of view. It's fine, because that is your point of view and your lifestyle. 

But at least see the point of view of vegetarians as well who don't eat meat because they have found a way to live without killing sentient beings to survive. Just because your point of view isn't the same as vegetarians doesn't mean that the vegetarian outlook on food has to be wrong. It's just different.

So from my perspective, it's totally pointless to make an animal and then kill it, whether or not it's ""sentient"" because it's totally useless when you don't have to eat meat in the first place. Why not just put your resources into making all kinds of veggies more available? It's a waste of energy for what...for the sake of taste? Anyway that's my point of view.

PS (and if you'd like, the **TLDR**),  just to make it clear and to reiterate on what you said, [not all] vegetarians eat fake meat because they need to remind themselves what it's like to eat animals; fake meat is also simply a substitute for a society in which eating meat is so prevalent that it makes it convenient to create (plant based!!!) substitutes in its place. The whole create a brainless animal just to kill it for its meat thing seems really pointless to me when you have substitutes anyway...and no offense, is the exact opposite of appetizing.

When discussing the subject at hand, rather than argue the merits or flaws of the argument you're responding to, you instead tried to suggest that an entirely unrelated thing was bad, too -- solely for the Pavlovian, knee-jerk response that it evokes amongst people with whom you most likely identify or were looking to draw support from.

In a nutshell, the only reason that someone would respond to the accusation that corporations can be defined as psychopaths with the statement that government would be defined as kleptomaniacs, is if you wanted to dismiss the accusation against Corporations or shift blame away from Corporations onto a scapegoat, in this case Government. This is called the Equivalence Fallacy.

If that wasn't your intention, why did you mention it at all? You didn't provide a counter-point at all -- you just changed the subject to something else.

&gt;Voting is largely an illusion, especially with an organization as large as the United States.

It's not an illusion, but it isn't perfect. It does, however, show that people (plural) are largely incapable of understanding systems that extend beyond their immediate, local area. It also illuminates how susceptible people are to propaganda. This is also an excellent argument against the Free Market, ironically. People are incapable of choosing in their best interests even when their hands are held. If they were on their own, they would becomes slaves.

**&lt;Edit&gt;**: As an aside (not directed at you), I think it's remarkable that the people who are most in favor of the ""invisible hand of the market,"" which supposedly allows the best products to rise and allows for the most efficient allocation of resources compared with any system, are always incredibly quick to downvote based not on the merits of a post but instead on how it makes them feel. Usually, based on whether it agrees with their world view. **&lt;/Edit&gt;**

&gt;The bigger the State, the less your vote counts.

That's because of the senate, which at this point may as well just be done away with in lieu of a different system. The Senate was never meant to be directly elected by the people, so in its current incarnation it's less than useless.","1270082993"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Why do you think we create art or have children?  One thing about humans raising children:  we expect them to take our teachings, grow up, and become responsible adults themselves (and parents, should they want to do so).  We don't expect them to praise our every action forever.  And our punishments (or necessary penance, if you prefer) tend not to revolve too much around blood sacrifice.  If God were a mortal parent we'd consider him monstrous and egomaniacal.

There are plenty of material reasons for us to create art or have children.  As far as we can objectively tell, our reasons are rooted in evolved instincts that can be explained by the enviroment that formed us.  Life geared toward passing it's genes on outlasts life that doesn't.  And our interest in art is connected to pattern recognition, habitat selection, social heirarchy, and a host of other things.  None of these things apply to perfect, immortal beings.  The closest to rational explanation I can think of is that god, naturally being on the highest tier of the heirarchy of needs, seeks self actualization.  Okay, fine.  That doesn't mean anyone has to appreciate or agree with god's chosen method of self expression.

You still didn't answer whether or not an eternal punishment was justifiable (whether fire or infinite regret).

The bible is an awfully contradictory and confusing road map.  Life is short and the penalty for making a wrong turn at the wrong moment is unthinkably long.  Back to your point about the consequence of our failure being death.  Why death?  And why that for a crime we didn't even understand until after we had commited it?

How does an omniscient being hide a stain?  ""A gruesome stopgap.""  I'm not sure where to begin with that.  The problem with trying to talk logically about magic (or miracles, if you prefer) is that the concept breaches objective causality.","1270082997"

-Front end language.   Javascript and ""ajax""

-Interactive: Flash or Java Applets.  You can also do things with Ajax/javascript; but depends on what you want to do.  Something like games or video is probably best done in flash (for now).

-Imaging/Graphics.   Photoshop is very common.  paint.net also works for some simple graphics.  Or gimp (linux).

-Webservers: if you want nice redirects, security features, etc - then some of this is done on the webserver level.  Apache is the most common.

The first ever genetically modified organism approved for field testing was a common plant-associated bacteria (Pseudomonas syringae) that had its ice nucleating activity eliminated in a hope that by spraying it on plants it could out-compete native populations of the bacteria with ice-nucleating activity thereby preventing frost damage.","1270083054"

&gt; Some countries: were accepted, rightly or wrongly, in the full and open knowledge that their numbers were not fully compliant with EMU criteria.

Nope. Every country that was admitted, had to fully qualify and did when admitted. Greece's qualification and admittance in the Eurozone was honest and never contested by anyone. 

&gt; Greece: in addition to the above, told lies and used false accounting practices to represent their numbers as being different from what they were.

 The *lies* thing: It's not about getting in the Eurozone, but for last year's national accounts that are blamed as a major factor of the debt crisis. 

The Greek government projected a 2009 budget deficit of 3.75% in June 2009 and then 6% in the fall before conceding that the real deficit was going to be 12.7%. That's all there is to it. It is a huge deal, but if not for the recession no one outside Greece would probably even notice. 

Edit: 

Unless of course you are actually referring to that couple of years before admittance, where Greece's deficit was 4% and 3,38% and intentionally cooked down to 3%. That's not a lie, that's common financial sense.

It's discourse! Hooray discourse!

&gt;The father is indirectly telling his kid to fuck off, 

It's rather direct, if you ask me . . . 

&gt;and that means his father is a negative influence in his life. 

That's one distinct possibility. I'm not denying that.

&gt;The kid isn't really a kid. He's a young adult and he tells us he can get by on his own for the three months.

Yes. And that's part of the reason I think he's capable of being more mature and level-headed than his father.

&gt;I say he should use the experience of having a shitty parent to his advantage 

I think you mean ""he should use the experience of having a shitty moment with his parent to his advantage"". You're assuming this is another in a long line of shitty parenting decisions. I'm not. That's the main difference between our opinions.

&gt;take control of his life by getting the fuck out and providing for himself.

This isn't taking control of his life. This is dealing with the shit that rained on him, and it's only one way of doing it. The other way is groveling back to his father. This is also dealing with the situation. He doesn't seem happy with either, so why not explore a third? Go back and *talk things out* to try and find exactly what's going on and whether he can still respect his father after that. He seems to *want* a chance to talk it out, hell, he seems to like debate in general! Why not drop the pretenses and try to handle this issue at its heart rather than the proxy of ""differing religious positions."" He doesn't need to leave forever or crawl back with his tail between his legs per his father's ultimatum, he can try to do things *his way* and rise about the hand he's been dealt. 

Though, I do acknowledge he might no want to, and reflection might reveal that.

&gt;No looking back.

I disagree with this completely. Now is the time he *needs* to look back and reflect on this. He could barrel, or he could figure out what he wants. This involves looking back and looking ahead. 

&gt;The only question is how the son should handle his father years from now when the father is wracked with guilt at being such an asshole. That's assuming the father is still human enough to feel remorse.

His father wasn't reflecting on anything, past or future. He'll only start feeling guilt when he looks back on what a good kid he had and how he acted in this present. Unfortunately, those feelings work both ways. The poster could be sitting there looking at how stupid it was that their past relationship was broken apart over something like this. Looking back simply tells him whether that relationship deserved to be treasured or not and helps inform him on where to go from here. How else would he know which direction he needs to go?","1270083122"

should you consider training your body like this, not only will you be functionally useless, but you will be prone to injury as well.

at a bare minimum, you need to add a glute-ham exercise (such as the deadlift, romanian deadlift, or the bodyweight option glute-ham raise), and an upper body pull (luckily for you, the king of upper body pulls is bodyweight).

if you absolutely don't want to do weights (though I'm really not sure why, some plate-loadable dumbbells from wal mart will give you great results with proper training), id recommend you just pick up the book [Never Gymless](http://www.rosstraining.com/nevergymless.html).

If we may confine the discussion to ethics, let's use a more dramatic example:  Some dude has a cabinet full of high-powered rifles, and he *never* locks his front door.  Someone comes in, takes one of the rifles, and murders a person.

Is the dude liable for murder?  No, but he is *partially* responsible, because his negligence was not accidental.  If he'd left the front door unlocked *just that one day*, it's not systematic negligence, and he's not responsible at all.  If someone broke down his front door, then he's also not responsible, because he took prudent measures to ensure that folks could not get in easily.  

But leaving the front door unlocked every day?  That's definitely negligence.  Dude knows that his house contains dangerous weapons and has a responsibility to make them difficult for strangers to access.

My father went to a Catholic boarding school. They had to confess every day and got beaten if they didn't confess any sins. He lay awake at night thinking of things he could confess, even if he didn't do any of it.

I was raised Catholic because my mother is a bit soft on critical thought regarding this matter. I held my fathers disdain for religion against him for a very long time until I was mature enough to start questioning religion. Now I feel kind of sad I never talked about religion with my dad. We really grew apart for the longest time. Since a few years (after my parents finally decided to put an end to their marriage), I've gotten a lot closer to my dad. I can now understand why he hated the church. He has an IQ of 150 - they had to beat the ignorance into him, but I guess they failed.

Your statement should have read 'There are plenty of good people. Some are Catholics.' 

Being Catholic, Christian, Jew, Muslim or Pastafarian for that matter doesn't make you any better person if it doesn't reflect in your actions.

I'll bet those Catholics wouldn't have said to a hungry person at the soup kitchen ""No, we won't tell you about your religion, we're here to feed you."" It's all part of the small incrementalism by which they slowly convert people. Catholics are very sneaky in that regard. Start young, skip the Old Testament, and guilt trip you into believing.

1. an election, as a comprehensive energy strategy, along with populist schemes like a ""gas tax holiday"" which would not have worked 
2. as a *solution* to *very high petrol prices of the time* (take a moment to remember those prices),
3. Sarah Palin being touted as a energy expert, who was responsible for a gas pipeline and whose state supplied 20% of America's energy. 

IMO, all 3 above is BS. 

Anyone who thinks offshore drilling is taboo, any petrol use, any local drilling should be disappointed by Obama now. And should get on their bicycle. The reality is that most Americans drive, and energy has to come from somewhere. If American goals are to transition to renewable energy **and** be less reliant on foreign oil, then looking for oil locally goes towards fulfilling the latter goal. 

The real hypocrisy IMO is when people do the easy thing and rail against politicians, instead of advocating eating locally, riding bicycles, refusing plastic bags (some made of petrol) etc. 

&gt;I find this rather blatant hypocrisy interesting though and it only reinforces my opinion that the left is swiftly losing it's intellectual edge as more people jump on the bandwagon who have little or no understanding of the actual issues and simply follow along behind a charismatic leader with the rest of the throng.

Some of that money isn't coming from Jewish people, it's coming from Christian Zionists. And further, opinions within the Jewish community, as I understand it, have changed in the 15+ years since the book was written. Further, it's not clear whether the ""Jewish-funded political action committees"" that the author refers to are necessarily donating with Israel in mind. Jewish people in general are very socially involved (one of the tenets of their religion is to ""make the world a better place""), and the figure that the author cites may include those donations directed toward a variety of other social issues.

I had an old, old, olllllld friend who, when he started dating his current girlfriend, was expressly no longer allowed to hang out with me without her present. She insisted on tagging along. Everything we did was innocent: dinner, drinks in a bar with other friends, whatever.

And you know what? I don't know her. She's almost 10 years younger than me and I have little in common with her. She was only there to keep an eye on us. And that isn't fun. It changes the dynamic that we had that I enjoyed so much.

I knew him before she did. We were friends before that and nothing was ever inappropriate. I felt like one of the guys when I hung out with him. But we no longer hang out. Her possessiveness really interfered in what was a lovely friendship.

And to be honest, I sorta lost respect for him to see that he was the kind of guy who would 100% capitulate to a demand like that.","1270083223"

"nosleep","t5_2rm4d","Hmm. The way you describe the room being eerily illuminated sounds like a conscious state sometimes referred to as 'Astral Traveling'. You were consciously perceiving the spiritual realm coterminous to the real world while you were asleep. The vast, vast majority of people have more distinctly defined borders between their waking state and sleeping state, so when they fall asleep they consciously black out. 

I've made a conscious effort to achieve this state myself, and managed to succeed a bare handful of times (I've gotten lazy since, however). The hardest part I find is pulling away from the body, since there's a weird 'magnetic' pull back towards it. The closer you are, the stronger the pull. Most of the times I've managed the trick of staying awake while going to sleep, I've just been stuck inside myself looking out. More practice is required, it seems.

As for the figure you saw, well... the lowest spiritual level closest to the waking world is realm to both the living and the dead. However! Before you start getting paranoid about going to sleep because of ghosts, consider that that's essentially what *you* are, with the added bonus of being tethered to that living proton pack of energy you call your body.

If it ever happens again, and some aimless spirit comes pestering you, just be polite, but firm. Remind them that they've got their own spiritual matters that they should be attending to, and if they've forgotten or got stuck, all they need to do is express a desire to seek help from above. 

You can also try what poster Alchemist was doing and alter things (it's a realm of pure thought after all, so get that mind to start sculpting!). You can even apply this to your own spiritual form. Become your favorite superhero, or turn into a knight in shining armor. ","1270083230"

I would recommend you keep your thoughts to the domain of your mind and that alone unless they both suggest a polygamous relationship to you. Though my situation was different, I've been in a similar predicament where we agreed to have multiple partners and it lead our relationship down the toilet.

Obama will surpass this but the GFC is pretty much to blame. Reagan's combination of tax cuts and spending increases was a choice his administration made.

George W Bush wasn't great either, but his fiscal irresponsibility pales in comparison to that of Reagan.

I love how Conservatives laud Reagan for his fiscal conservatism. The reality is that no other president in post-war history ran such big budget deficits and oversaw an expansion in government spending as big as Reagan.

I'm not sure if content is the problem. I think when ""normal"" people talk, content is unimportant and contentless language is the goal. When nerds talk, they are trying to literally communicate rather than merely grunting at each other like animals. I think it comes from reading vs non-reading. People who don't read don't understand (experience might be the right word) language on it's own terms. 

For normal people, the rule seems to be keep talking, about nothing, incessantly. When your language has content, and your communication style takes a backseat to the content, the tone suddenly seems awkward and frightening. Some of your content may also risk engaging parts of the brain that they normally don't use when speaking and I can imagine that's a traumatic experience for many people. ","1270083370"

Additionally - one thing to note - when I say ""one hundredth"", I'm not specifying what was actually spent - I'm specifying how much is AVAILABLE.  The amount of money available to any nonprofit, Greenpeace, Sierra Club, NRDC, etc - is literally dwarfed by the amount of money available to the oil and coal lobby.  We all saw Exxon Mobil rake in billions of dollars in profits during the gas price spike in the US a few years ago.  IMHO, if something large was to come up that could mean real action on climate change, they would dip into their treasuries and spend what they needed to misinform the public.  The nonprofits don't have a backup fund, they're just out there with what they've got.

Also, you can variate those compound movements to isolate the muscles you want to work better. For example, a closer grip on the bench press will work more triceps and deltoids, and an underhand grip when doing pullups will put emphasis on the biceps.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","One of the things that was hard to cope with in my psychotic episode was that I had (what I called) a range of different hypotheses to explain to myself what I was experiencing.... I didn't suffer from one particular delusion. Instead -- I KNEW that what was going on was NOT normal -- and I kept trying to come up with a reasonable explanation for myself about what was happening and what I was experiencing.... 

Because of knowing a couple of schizophrenic people in the past (before this had happened to me) and having studied the subject a little bit before, I knew off the top of my head that the typical persecution stuff -- like the CIA or UFOs or World Conspiracy type stuff was not applicable to my hypotheses of what was going on... So I dismissed these things accordingly..... I think I was very lucky in that regard -- in that I was able to tell myself that even if my *experience* seemed to be telling me that the universe was responding to my thoughts in a way that it did not ordinarily do (at least that was my perception) that there had to be a REASONABLE explanation for it....

I won't discuss publicly what my hypotheses were... I am scared to. Some of it is just very very embarrassing now -- like gamercats talking about his understanding that religious delusions of talking to god were simply ridiculous when he got well...

It's SO hard to explain this kind of experience.... unless you have been there -- you will never understand it.. and believe me -- you really do NOT want to experience it enough to understand it....

The best way I can explain it -- (and one of the hypotheses that I did conjecture about while psychotic) was - it was a little like how people have described being on acid.... (only a little) -- except I did not take any drugs.... But for awhile -- I was afraid to eat or drink anything, because I surmised that somebody had slipped me some kind of drug -- somehow... and that it would eventually wear off so long as I did not ingest anything.... but this also made me paranoid about the people around me -- because there was no other explanation as to how the drugs got into me that were causing me to experience this altered state.

In private, I might talk about some of the experiences I felt... the weird ... seemingly -- alternate reality type things that it felt like I was experiencing when I was sick... but it's so scary to do this.

It's been a long time since I had this kind of episode... but I am scared to death of it re-curring... and I have, perhaps an irrational feeling that if I talk about it -- I will make it come back.... or it will come back.

I am an uber-rational person.... I don't let myself think about these things except in very very general and broad ways -- and I try very hard to keep my emotional distance from the subject by intellectualizing and trying to reason my way through it -- and not let the *feelings* come back.

It's kind of like saying, ""I'm not here to spoil your fun, I'm just here to make sure nobody gets hurt.""  In other words, ""I'm going to spoil your fun, but that's just a side-effect of the good thing I'm here to do.""

Let me throw a quote at you.  It's somewhere in Matthew:  ""You have heard it said, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.  But I say to you, do not resist evil, and if someone strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.""

The iPad is a **console**. Like a Gameboy, not like a computer. The iPad is a device for doing things like that—having fun little experiences, like playing with your music and watching movies and other things people do when they get home from the office. It's a piece of consumer electronics. People like you get angry because it's not a computer. Well, *that's the point*. It's not a computer. It won't replace computers, subsume computers, or do anything to computers. Computers are necessary and separate, most obviously because you need them to develop the software that runs on the damn things.

Consoles have had horrid certification processes for years. The first one was started by Nintendo in 1985. This resulted in the recovery from the games crash, which had been a direct result of the inability of consumers to find quality software titles in the market. It's not ""bad capitalism""—it encourages faith in the product ecosystem (that is, ""it makes people know they won't get ripped off."") This causes them to put more money into the ecosystem. That's *good* capitalism.

-----

Also, I think you're confused about my usage of the word ""add-on"" here. ""Add-on"" means ""something with a check-box under 'features' on your product order invoice."" It's *not* the same as ""aftermarket accessory""—it's something *the manufacturer* sells. An all-leather interior is an add-on; you can choose to buy the car with it or without it. There are two models of the car, and your choice of the add-on determines which model you get. It's still the same *car*—it just has two versions, one with the add-on, and one without. iPhones are sold with a laser engraving ""add-on."" Computers are sold with an antivirus subscription ""add-on.""

And you can, in fact, buy a new 2010 convertible car without the folding roof; the car dealership five blocks away from me would be happy to sell me such a car. It's the one sitting right beside the version of itself that has the folding roof.

"vim","t5_2qhqx","One word: **autoindent**. I have an OCD when it comes to properly formatted code. When I have to edit someone else's code, it can become a real problem since I have my vimrc set to tab indent every 4 spaces, whereas other people like to tab indent every 2 spaces. Obviously, it's a waste of time/effort to reformat someone else's code to match your style, not to mention a dick move. My simple solution is typing == to produce quick, clean lines. Other useful stuff in no particular order:

* %: toggle between start/end braces
* *: find next instance of word under cursor
* ""xyy: store yanked line into register x. This is good for saving anything you constantly reuse to vim's clipboard. You can paste it using ""xp, or view the clipboard using :registers

Really cool plugins I can't live without: 

* Nerd Commenter: best plugin for quickly commenting lines of text
* MRU: allows you to see the last ten files you opened
* Buffer Explorer: switch quickly between different open buffers; Kind of like ctrl-tab, but shows you file paths, and it allows you to quickly open/close buffers.","1270083553"

if you feel secure enough in your relationship that you think that this is worthwhile, then why not?  i mean, if i were i your shoes, i'd seriously consider it.  but then again, i'm bored with my job and want to travel.

about the logistics:  if you do decide to go, spend some time beforehand preparing some sort of web-based business.  freelancing, dev shop, web app, whatever best fits your skill set.  

this way, you'll have a fall-back plan to make some $.  it'll be much better for you to spend time working on your own project and making *some* money and then searching for a job there on the side than it would be searching for a job full time.

In case you're too busy trolling the web to click the link, I'll include the definition here:

–verb (used without object)
1.
to present reasons for or against a thing: He argued in favor of capital punishment.
2.
to contend in oral disagreement; dispute: The Senator argued with the President about the new tax bill.

&gt;It's awesome how there are atheists in these subreddits who manage to sound as reactionary and idiotic as any faux news personality.

Now, mind you I'm not as wise as you supposedly are, but doesn't that constitute 'contending in oral disagreement'?

Oh, and while we're add it, here's one of the definitions of the word 'fag'.

n.
a repellent male. (Rude and derogatory.) : You creepy fag. Stop it!

Now, seeing as how I never mentioned homosexuality once in my posts (other than to condemn the bible for condemning it), I think any reasonable man could conclude that based on the CONTEXT of my words, this was the appropriate definition of the word to assume.

Now you're just grasping for straws, trying to keep the argument going. Should I direct you to the definition of the word 'troll', or has my point been made clearly enough for you?

The magic in those programs isn't in any magical techniques written in there (even if they try to convince you otherwise), it's that it forces you to actually interact with people and learn from those interactions.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I am Indian and while the concept of a full arranged marriage, where the guy and the girl have no choice, does happen in India(mostly rural); Its not always the case over here. Quick break down of how it would happen here, assuming the parents are atleast alittle open-minded:

 * A matchmaker for that community sends pictures of the guy and girl to both families. 
 * Guy and Girl check each others picture out.
 * If they approve based on the picture, then a meeting between both families is arranged.
 * If the family likes girl, and the girls family likes the guy. Then the guy and the girl meet alone, usually a couple of times. 
 * If they feel they are compatible, then the families go ahead and make arrangements for the marriage.  


OP's case might be different, but this is how it is in my community.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Which is not true. All the FreeBSD and Mach stuff is not written in Objective-C.

All the ""FreeBSD and Mach"" stuff are officially titled Darwin, and nothing at this level is really classes as an *application*. Hence, when I referred to Mac applications I was explicitly targeting the higher-levels of the system.

Furthermore, there are Objective-C classes for interfacing with pretty much everything in Darwin.

Regardless there's still a huge amount of Objective-C code in the hundreds of thousands of Mac and iPhone apps.

The point is that there's a lot more using Objective-C than just UI. The Cocoa frameworks cover everything from managing files to distributed programming and parallelism, all the way up to things like doing pixel-level manipulation of images the GPU, and drawing graphics on screen.

Edit: It's interesting to note that a lot of lower level things, such as all drivers for Drawin back when the system belonged to NeXT, used to be written in Objective-C. This ws before Apple decided that driver developers were more comfortable in C++.

Note: The fact that Objective-C is a [true] pure-superset of C is a huge advantage, not a disadvantage.

&gt; Weren't we talking about mind-blowing recent stuff?

Hey Smalltalk is 30 years old and the concepts there is still decades ahead of what the mainstream is using. It doesn't need to be something written last year to be mind blowing.

I noticed that you glossed over the most exciting things in my list, some of which is only a few years old, like Gilad Bracha's work on how generalised nesting of classes enables first-class parametric modules.

This is really useful, really practical, really impressive work, and it makes modules in functional languages like *ML look antiquated (despite *ML being widely attributed as having devised the best module systems thus far).

If you care to take a serious look at the list you might learn something.

&gt; Agora and Obliq have been abandoned more than a decade ago, haven't they?

Two extensive research projects that died out due to research cuts etc.

The ideas contained therein however are still revolutionary, even if they're not talked about. Agora in particular makes as much of a contribution to object-oriented programming as Smalltalk or Self!

&gt; Stuff like Predicate Dispatch is also more than a decade old and I'm pretty sure it existed before that somewhere in the Prolog community.

I really don't see how it applies to Prolog.

I don't know when predicate dispatch was first documented but it allows you to do things with dispatch that should make even the hardened pattern-matcher a little jealous.

To fit this into the context of the wider discussion predicate dispatch allows you to do everything you would do with pattern matching, while remaining typically extensible.

Pattern dispatch is quite similar in some respects but has some interesting properties of its own.

&gt; Is there anything really exciting new in the OO world that is of practical use? Used by somebody?

There's plenty of new and exciting stuff, but you wont find it being used much in the real world anymore than you'll find cutting edge research in functional programming being used.

The world seems happy enough using mediocre shit like Java and isn't really looking to change anytime soon – which I consider a huge shame.

&gt; CLOS was developed with the MOP from the start... The MOP part is the ground breaking part.

Which is strange because Smalltalk had a MOP for as long as it's had meta-classes, which is the beginning (before CLOS came about).

That's why I can't really regard CLOS itself as being groundbreaking.

&gt; At least Alan Kay thought that the AMOP book was important, though unfortunately for him, using Lisp.

He recognised it as important because he already knew how powerful the idea was from his work on Smalltalk.

And the AMOP certainly is an important book.

Paul is telling Christian slaves to witness (ie demonstrate their faith) to their masters. I guess it's a stoical statement. It's also clearly the position of one wishing to put Christ before all things - what should they do instead? Will overthrowing or murdering their masters help them [the masters] to become Christians? No, probably not.

You'd have to do more than contend this, you'd have to argue for it. It seems pretty intuitively implausible. I care about whether my beliefs are true, not merely about whether they appear true.

&gt;You'd have to be quite a monster to disregard all that, to assert that they must be wrong about their own consciousness

Again, you're the one claiming that in a simulated reality, there'd be a 1-to-1 correspondence of conscious 'AI' agents to simulated people. You'd need to argue this. Why couldn't they all be 'puppets' or one AI, for example? Or merely governed by an incredibly large set of rules, but no AI whatsoever. Again, I'm not asserting that is possible. You're the one asserting it isn't, and have to provide a reason for this.

Why can't the EM cheat? It doesn't cheat at providing the right experiences. It just doesn't, e.g., fully simulate a table when you're not looking.

A good console or computer RPG (in my opinion) allows the player to choose *anywhere* they want to go in the game world - to a point, obviously it's fun to have to unlock some areas - and to follow all kinds of different quest chains toward all kinds of different ends.  Of course I know that Oblivion &amp; Fallout 3 have a main quest line, but once you've gone through it, you can start a new game and completely ignore it, just living &amp; adventuring in the game world, constantly trying to find new things to do.

My ideal game would be able to dynamically generate new content while still allowing for a rich story line and complex quest chains.  It might not be possible to do this without human intervention (a 'digital DM', if you will) and/or super high-tech AI, but it should be possible to do *somehow*.  I want to be able to play a game indefinitely and have it feel like a real place.  I want to never have any idea what could happen next.  I want NPCs that remember something about my character's past choices but who don't always lead me down the same path if I play with a different character (especially if I act differently)-- who have somewhat predictable patterns like real people, but who also can occasionally surprise you *like real people*.  I want an honest attempt at a realistic simulation.  This is what I play games for, personally.

My younger self would be appalled at how popular so many of these utterly linear games are-- although I've played a few and understand how they can be enjoyable, they are simply not as fun for me as a more open game world.  I guess people are just a lot more easily tricked into believing they're making free choices than I'd like to think.  This is why the human race is doomed, I tell ya...","1270083819"

"beer","t5_2qhg1","There is slightly more to the story, but you get the gist.


The co-owner and co-founder (George Stranahan) of Flying Dog actually was neighbors with HST in Woody Creek just outside Aspen  for decades (Hence the name of their Woody Creek White witbier).   If you read many of HST books you will find repeated mentions of him over the years; often involving beer, booze, firearms, and explosions.  

The artist Ralph Steadman was a close friend of HST's and consequently Stranahan's as well, so it was only natural that they would tap him to do the artwork which draws heavily on his work with HST (the BATS!).  

HST did not have any direct relationship with the brewery or its operations, but he was unquestionably a big part of inspiration and support for its establishment.

Yes, yes it is. Despite efforts to obscure it, that's exactly what this is about.

&gt;the issue here isn't the ""convenience"", of being protected under the constitution for free speech. what the poster said was that these fear-monger foxnews pundits that are being paid to spout this nonsense are in a convenient position.

Yes, they are.

&gt;they can just go on the air and incite violence and not be held accountable,

First off, they are angry and other people are going along with their anger. That is not the same thing as inciting violence. They can be as angry as they want about whatever they want and tell it to as many people as they want.

&gt;and actually benefit from other people carrying out these words. it's not ""free speech"" that we're upset about.

No, the person I was replying to was upset about free speech. He is clearly implying that people who are upset with their government and speak about it should be ""held responsible"" for what other upset parties do. 

&gt;it's the fact that these talking heads don't seem to care that they are condoning and fanning the flame of violence. nobody is upset that people are criticizing the government, or the ""potential damage"" of having political opinion. people are upset because these cushy congressmen and pundits are encouraging violence.

Very few have said anything endorsing violence. Even fewer have done so. The RNC/Fox/Republicans have made people angry by talking about how angry they are. That's it.

When it all comes down to it, with *few*(but existant) exceptions, all that can be said is that they riled people up in anger. That's legal.

What exactly is the alternative here? What should be done to these people for their insolence? (Bearing in mind that if they *actually* threaten someone/literally encourage violence, they're already liable)","1270083877"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","you have several places where color profiles are important:

monitor
photoshop workspace
file
printer
probably others but this is all you should really care about right now.

imagine the icc profile as a set of instructions on how to render the RGB values, a translator if you will. on your monitor, this is to compensate for the color shifts and whatnot and maximize the gamut your monitor is capable of. in the printer, it's to compensate for the inks and paper substrate color/Dmax. in the software, it's to make sure that things play nicely.

visualize the color spaces. a quick google img search will bring up the various plots for adobe 98, sRGB, profoto, etc graphed on Lab chart. for all intensive purposes, you should be working in adobe 98 for the software end of it. profoto is bigger, but most cameras now can shoot to adobe 98 and thus it works out fine. if you want, by all means use profoto. DO NOT SHOOT TO SRGB.

[sRGB gamut](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/CIExy1931_sRGB.png/325px-CIExy1931_sRGB.png) vs. [adobe '98 gamut](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/CIExy1931_AdobeRGB.png)

adobe is much larger, no?
shooting in adobe 98 means you're capturing more information, much like shooting in 14 or 16 bit is much more than 8bit. you dont want to start the system off limiting yourself in gamut.

so now you've got your camera RAW file, right out of the camera, lets say 8bit adobe '98. your monitor is set to, i'm going to assume, the factory default. your monitor cannot display all of the adobe 98 gamut (someone correct me if i'm wrong, but none can yet, right?), so you need a way to crunch those adobe 98 colors down to what your display is capable of showing. thus the profile for the monitor. setting your monitor to adobe 98 isn't the way to do it; the color fidelity is straight up thrown to the curb and your monitor is pretty much shifting colors however it wants. the correct way is to use a colorimeter to measure how your monitor *wants* to render a specific set of colors. the colorimeter software then generates an icc profile (again, think of it as a translator) to compensate for your hardware. similarly, with your printer, it cannot print all of the adobe 98 colorspace (reflective vs. transmissive mediums and color shifts due to substrate color).

this didn't help us out any if we where give the problem of 3x^2 -9x +7/8 and told to find the roots. we could find the value of m and n, and use the new quadratic equation, or we could 'skip' that step and just use the old one.

the only real reason for redefining the old vars with new one, would be if those new vars where useful in another equation or if their values where tabulated in a large tabled appendix. otherwise all your doing is making another intermediate in a problem. but, if the new classy/attractive where to give most of the time (or again, tabulated in an appendix) than that might justify defining a new variable.

Well, either way these people are stupid.  The will to troll requires a distinct lack of intelligence.

How do these people imagine that inciting others to anger or inspiring false beliefs with remarks that have every appearance of sincerity because they've been consciously and assiduously designed to appear sincere proves or even suggests that those individuals who respond with anger/frustration/false belief are inferior to the issuers of those insincere remarks?

Trolls are *by necessity* not altogether very bright - for various reasons.  Another reason is that morality, despite what some short-sighted tools and troglodytes would say, is actually in one's own best interests.  This principle is referred to as enlightened self-interest.  Moral action comprises showing consideration for others, trying to promote the welfare of others as much as it lay within one's power to do so.  Since the objective of trolling is to rouse up negative emotions or to turn a person into an object of ridicule and scorn, trolling is not moral and not, therefore, in one's best interests, though trolls believe otherwise.  This suggests intellectual myopia which, in turn, suggests or, rather, *is* stupidity or a facet thereof.  (My remarks are made in the hopes that trolling will abate, since it's such a waste of everyone's time [particularly that of the trolls], and not in order that I should make anyone feel worse than it is necessary for them to feel so that they should resolve to troll no longer.)

It's depressing that /b/ and much of the internet at large is full of people who are trying to prove their intelligence through the act of trolling and who completely fail to grasp that their very will to troll, in the first place, is proof of the unexceptional nature of their intellects.  I've never met an internet troll on whose part there were ever the least evidence of above-average intelligence; the most intelligent tend to come across as sincere, helpful, kind, understanding, and tolerant.

P.S.  The semantic value of the word 'troll' has been expanded to such a degree - at least on Reddit - that it's meaning is largely indistinct now from the words 'irony' and 'sarcasm'.  Is that all you meant?  That some of the comments in this thread were ironic?  The use of irony doesn't imply the intent to deceive or upset, but rather to amuse and regale through the fairly conspicuous obfuscation of one's meaning.  There's an enormous difference between trolling and irony, then, and I would hope that Redditors would not conflate these words.","1270083996"

It wasn't Muslims who trained their cameras on the World Trade Center Towers prior to the first aircraft impact, who danced and celebrated with high fives; and then were released without investigation by Manhattan Judge Mukasey, Bush's eventual DOJ chief.I was Israelis.

It wasn't Muslims who were caught on 9/11/01 operating in teams with vans full of explosives, including one team who attempted to blow up the George Washington Bridge with a truck packed with tons of explosives, and another who blew up a van between 6th and 7th on King Street with a mural painted of a remote controlled airplane diving into New York and blowing up. It was Israelis.

It wasn't Muslims who were caught shortly after midnight on May 7, 2002 very close to the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, Oak Harbor, Wash., (where the Navy conducts explosive ordnance training for bomb disposal mobile units to the consternation of local marine life) with a rental truck that tested positive for TNT and RDX plastic explosives. It was Israelis.

It wasn't Muslims who provided two hours' advance warning of an attack on the World Trade Center via an instant messaging company based in Herzliya. It was Israelis.

It wasn't Muslims who received advance warning on Monday September 10, 2001, against flying the next day.

It isn't Muslim countries that have a massive spy ring in the USA capable of tapping into much of the telecoms network and using information obtained to blackmail Americans. It was Israel.

It wasn't Muslims who acquired a 99-year lease on the World Trade Center's Twin Towers; and then made out like a bandit after the WTC was blown up. It was Larry Silverstein.

It wasn't a Muslim who went on TV within hours of the attacks to tell everyone that ""It... certainly has the fingerprints of somebody like bin Laden"". It was Jerome Hauer.

It wasn't Muslims who were caught and arrested inside the Mexican Congress chamber on October 10, 2001 in possession of guns, grenades, dynamite, detonators and wiring while posing as ""press photographers""; it was Mossad agent Salvador Guersson Smecke and Israeli illegal immigrant Saur Ben Zvi.

For mathematics is also a science, but mathematics is logic based, not empirical based.

Therefore, I think that is you that may not know what science about.  You seem to believe that a subset of science is the entire umbrella.

Having said that, we do in fact start with a question when it comes to the non-aggression principle.  The question is, is the initiation of force (which is a human relation and thus enforceable, making it a moral issue) a moral behavior or an immoral behavior?

One of these must be true.  It cannot be neither moral nor immoral, for initiation of force is a human relation and is enforceable.  Thus it resides in the realm of morality.

Since the answer must be one of the two, and since we can't just pick one because we like it and then wash our hands, we have to test each possibility and hold it up to an objective scientific standard, which is logical consistency and empirical validity.","1270084017"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Last week I walked to the mall (like a mile away or so) and I was walking back, this man in the parking lot asked to use my phone to call somebody. He looked like a decent guy, had a short haircut, sunglasses, had a bag from a store in the mall. Looked like a frat guy but in his 30's or so. 

He said his girlfriend left him there, and he forgot his cell in her car, so he needed to call her. No problem, he calls her, and gives me the phone. He makes some small talk, asks me if I go to college around there (it's a college town) and I tell him I do. 

Well he starts talking like he is just gonna ride the bus wherever, so he's kinda walking with me considering the bus stop is pretty much in front of where I'm staying at the time. Anyways, it's pretty dark outside, and him walking with me is kinda starting to freak me out. 

Well, he then starts talking about opening a club. Not just any club. A horror/bondage club that would offer ""therapeutic services"" by allowing people to cut up and stab human sized dolls. Talking about how going crazy is relaxing and how it can help people calm down. All the while he is pretty much staring at me and walking closer and closer to me. 

Now I'm really fucking scared.

So, I crossed at the next crosswalk, and he started following me again, when I turned around and told the man that the bus stop was on the other side of the street (it wasn't) and he should keep walking on the other side.

Never been so happy to make it home from the mall in my life.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","it is a highly competitive rts-style game. games consist of two teams of five people that each play as a different hero. there is a large pool of heroes available relative to the number of people in a game and each hero has different abilities.

the objective is to destroy the other team's main building that sits protected by a large base. periodically, weak ai-controlled units spawn at each of three spots in each teams base and they charge towards the opponents base. these weak units are worth experience to enemies as well as gold if they get the kill on them (experience is gained simply from being nearby, however). experience levels up your hero, increasing their stats (strength, intelligence, and agility) as well as giving one skill point per level that you can spend on new skills or boosting the power of a skill you already have.

each hero has 3 unique regular abilities that each have four ranks as well as an ultimate ability that has three ranks that you can only get once you are a specified level (you can get the first rank of your ultimate at level 6). 

the gameplay is very complex and not very intuitive. it is one of the most ruthless pools of gamers you will find due to the nature of the game; if you have never played before, you seriously can singlehandedly lose your team the game by dying over and over thus gifting the opposing heroes tons of experience and gold. in counterstrike (for example), it is practically impossible to be so bad that your team is better off with one less person than with you; worst case, you die immediately every round. but that is really no worse than not having you on the team in the first place. in dota/hon, however, it is very easy to be an active detriment to the team's success. since there are 4 other people on your team every game, it's also very easy for people when losing to point the finger at their ""horrible"" teammates rather than be self-critical. lots of factors come together to make the community one of the harshest in any game.

that said, it is an extremely sophisticated and tactical game. the learning curve for it is probably one of the steepest of any game out there, but if you have the patience to get good at it, it is an extremely rewarding game and it is much more fun if you are playing with 1-2 friends.

To actually answer the question, what _is_ the reason we are in Afghanistan, I will give the only explanations that make sense to me: 1) heroin -- Drugs = money; 2) control over fossils fuels; 3) control over territory (empire); 4) human attraction to war

***3. Control over territory***

[Strategic rivalry and conflict between the British Empire and the Russian Empire for supremacy in Central Asia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game)

***4. Human attraction to war***

How did all of these aggressive, largely unethical motivations result in an invasion and continued occupation?  The best explanation I have heard is the theory given in the book *The Psychology of War : Comprehending Its Mystique and Its Madness*.

Basically, the idea is that 'mythical thinking' (as opposed to observation and rational  thought) makes it possible to engage in activities (wars) that solve the most basic age-old human dilemma: the conflict between self and the group.

Put yourself in the position of U.S. leaders who see all of these strategic goals in Afghanistan. 

***What do you think would have been the reaction if they had simply presented all of these reasons and asked the American public for permission to invade Afghanistan on this basis in September 2001?***

&gt;In AD 1000, the Earth was experiencing an episode of climate warming similar to that of the present day. Temperatures in many parts of the world seem to have risen by at least two or three degrees Fahrenheit. 

&gt;Although the scale of this ""global warming"" may seem small, its effects on human societies were profound. In Europe, several centuries of long hot summers led to an almost unbroken string of good harvests, and both urban and rural populations began to grow. These centuries are known as the Medieval Warm Period. One of the more dramatic consequences of the Medieval Warm Period was the expansion of Viking settlements in the North Atlantic. From their Icelandic base (established in AD 870), the Norse people began to move west and north to Greenland, Canada, and eventually above the Arctic Circle.
LINK

&gt;The Medieval Warm Period was a time of warm weather around 800-1300 AD, during the European Medieval period. Initial research on the MWP and the following Little Ice Age (LIA) was largely done in Europe, where the phenomenon was most obvious and clearly documented. The Vikings took advantage of ice-free seas to colonize Greenland and other outlying lands of the far north.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;If this is true, why do virtually all major retail stores let you return what you bought and give you a full refund if you are not happy with the purchase?

Because it makes them more money. Their competitors offer a service where, if you certain reasons you're not happy with the product, you can return it. If you have to choose between two stores -- both have largely the same products, but one has a return policy and one does not -- you'll likely pick the return policy. You might even be willing to pay more than you otherwise would for that reassurance, effectively making it insurance. To compete the stores have to adopt that same policy.

If you come back to the store there's a chance that they can also sell you something else, something more expensive, or that you might see something else you're interested in. It's not bait and switch, per se, but it's the same general idea behind that tactic. The more times they can get you to visit the store, the more exposure you have to their sales staff and advertising, and the higher chance that you can walk away with more stuff.

It's also important to note that return policies don't cover all situations fathomable. If you return something because you broke it, they probably won't take it unless you purchased a warranty. The warranty, of course, is another method of making money because it's often quite lucrative, and often can be considered pure profit.

That being said, what you said has very little to do with self regulation at all.","1270084108"

To me this calls into question the utility of any position that argues against an objective morality. That is, every human law and rule is already an attempt at an objective claim about morality.  If you break the law, you can argue until you're blue in the face about deriving 'oughts from is' and the flimsy logic behind objective moral truth, but in the end, all that talk is academic, you'll still be held legally accountable. In the same sense, a philosopher, or someone on acid, may question causality and objective reality, but that is not going to stop scientists from building rockets and launching satellites. 

My point is, whether objective or not, moral values are already being imposed on us (and have been throughout history) through societal rules and systems of law; to not bring a scientific methodology to the study of morality, because the term 'objective morality' makes us uncomfortable, is incredibly irresponsible. And note, if the scientific community continues to be silent in this regard, the atavistic forces of culture and religion will surely have no qualms continuing to define objective morality for the rest of us.

They went out, but there wasn't enough attraction there to keep them together. Without more details I can't determine if the guy in question broke rule #2 or #3. In any case, the first guy was not attractive enough to continue to hold her interest. The second guy had #2 and #3 in spades, but then broke rule #1 with his (admittedly, yikes) terrible line. Miseleigh rejected both these men, and did so for completely valid reasons. Miseleigh then described (exactly how I would, I might add) the way females become and stay attracted to males, or in other words, the way males can be attractive and charming.

You're just supposed to know that.  You're arguing about whether or not something is an actual, verifiable fact.  

You obviously like Joss Whedon quite a bit if you're going to the trouble of attacking opposing opinions, and reducing the argument to whether or not aforementioned opinions have been clearly marked as such.

But when I read this: ""You're at X ... ok, Y is a neighboring point. Now choose another point A between X and Y""
 
Doesn't that essentially mean Y was *not* a neighboring point?
 
Basically what you are doing there with the 'very very close to X' you are going backwards, starting with points that are *not* neighbors of X, and getting closer and closer and never actually arriving at *the* neighbor of X.
 
Just because the Real numbers aren't countable... I don't know because I don't know the math rules and such so that's probably what I'm missing on... So ok look at this: 
 
Lets start with the assumption that there are &gt;2 neighbor points to X... 
 
So... A,B,C are our neighbor points. Meaning A != X, B != X, C != X.
 
Also... A != B != C .
 
So... either A &gt; B or A &lt; B ... B &gt; C or B &lt; C... A &gt; C or A &lt; C...
 
So... One of A,B,C is NOT a neighbor of X, for ANY 3 numbers you choose...
 
Therefore there cannot be more than 2 neighbors for X.

"offbeat","t5_2qh11","One time back in the old days of the internet,  around 1996 or so in the hey day of AOL, I met a girl,  16,  banging body,  blond.   Really something else,  especially for a nerd like me.

After school let out for summer I took a greyhound to Louisville to meet up with her.  It was a good 6 hours trip from north Alabama,  I was dying with anticipation.   So I arrive at the bus station where her father met me and took me back to their house.   

It was a nice red brick house in the suburbs of Louisville, completely inviting,  especially with this little pixie waiting to meet me after all those months.   As we walked through the front door he calls out her name,  but there's no response,  he looked in the garage and said she must've gone to grab some food or something.   I told me I could go watch TV in her room that was downstairs in the basement.  So I go the stairs and notice this smell,  kind of like dog shit.   It was dark and I was hunting for the switch in the light from the upstairs hallway when the door slammed shit and the lights came on.   This wasn't her bedroom.   It was a completely concrete room with nothing but a wooden chair, a small black and white tv and what appeared to be feces smeared all over the wall.   After a few hours of trying to figure out how the fuck I get out of this,   he opens the door and comes down the stairs,  no clothes,  just some fucking yellow dish gloves.   Anyhow, to make a long story short,  no matter how much my girlfriend bitches,  I'm not washing the goddamned dishes.","1270084310"

Having typed that, I think the wording of your original question begs the question. That is, by intimating belief or unbelief as the only possible reaction to a truth, you are begging for the free-will vs. determinism argument (I know this isn't exactly the right way to use beg the question).  I think a proper distinction would be to ask ""would everyone know it to be true.""   I think belief is something separate from knowledge.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In senior year of high school, a ""friend"" that I had since 6th grade executed a two year plan to steal my car.  

My car keys were missing after he visited my house one senior day and he showed up with some backup car keys that had been missing for two years, claiming he found it in the gutter.  While I saw it coming, I was too naive at the time, and I couldn't accept that such a thing would happen.  So the next day, I took the car to school with the backup car keys and the car was missing by the end of the school day.

The betrayal went further when he made public my accusation and turned several of my previous friends against me.  I wasn't the only one who thought that this was such an outrageous thing to believe, so a lot of my former friends didn't believe me and sided with him.

It was a pretty traumatic way to end high school, but there it is.  It took me several years to recover from it.  My keys and that wallet are still not to be found in my parents' house since that day he visited.

It actually took about five years to emotionally get over.   I don't have an enemies list, and I'm not sure ""forgive"" is a word I would use, but I've pretty much just moved on.  I've come out of it being a lot less trustful of people and being more analytical, instead of emotional, when I see such situations coming.","1270084419"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;He means ""science"" in the broad sense of applying critical thought. So this would include things like math and even literary theory.

Well he's using the word 'science' in an incredibly idiosyncratic way then. I'd hope Rorty would never have said anything so odd. Harris is welcome to use words how he wants, but if he's using them in radically different ways from the majority of the world's English speakers, he'd do well so say so. But I don't think he is, in any case.

This is of course not to say that scientific methodology is anything other than an extension of *some* of the ways in which we normally reason about the empirical world (perhaps something like this is the plausible point Rorty was making...?).

&gt;If there are people who think that the best possible use of their time is spent debating whether 'wellbeing' is actually good for people, they are welcome to do that I suppose. But these people should recognize that this is merely a debate about terminology. 

Well, for one thing there's a substantive debate to be had about whether wellbeing *as Harris understands it* (i.e. in terms of experience, and brain-states) is what we value. It's pretty implausible that he's right about this, as consideration of objections to hedonistic utilitarian theories shows.

But my main complaint here is that Harris claimed that science can tell us what we ought to value, and that what we ought to value is wellbeing, suggesting that science tells us that we value wellbeing. That claim is very controversial. I'm not remotely suggesting we *shouldn't* value wellbeing. I'm suggesting that what Harris says about science telling us this is false, or at least something he gives us absolutely no reason to accept. Of course, if you can find some true claim in the vicinity here by re-interpreting the word 'science' in odd ways, you're welcome to do so.

...until he was.  Hence the guy who was only *just* a musical prodigy became, after a couple of years on the streets, a street-wise tough guy as well.  

&gt; Your example of his encounter with the dragon is another perfect example of one of his failures. He basically wasted all that drug, and put the town in danger, and though he played the hero in the end, he was only able to do so after he messed things up terribly.

No, he didn't create the dragon, and he was the only one to take the dragon seriously (remember the townsfolk were clueless/didn't care), and he encounters a fortune in (basically) heroin.  Rothfuss could've easily added a zero to the amount of heroin and Kvothe would've killed the dragon *and* made a fortune.  But he didn't add a zero.  Why?  So Kvothe could be seen to make a sacrifice for everyone else--a sacrifice that only he knows about (aside from the girl).  So his character is written to be a martyr figure.

&gt; He's been swindled, beaten up, kicked out of places, shunned; the list goes on.

Maybe ""martyr"" is a better word for what I mean.  This kind of reinforces that.

I was wearing my favorite suit which didn't fit me perfectly because of my large stomach.  I entered the office and was directed to sit in a chair just inside and facing away from the door.  I barely fit between the armrests and as I sat down, my pockets caught on each arm rest and my pants scooched down 3/4 of the way off my ass.  I knew this due to the cold draft coming in from the open door behind me.  This was no mild plumbers crack.  It was AWFUL! I did fantastic with the questions because they were the least of my worry since the whole time I was distracted and hoping that the administrative assistant outside the door could not see my big fat ass.  When I sat up I gently put my fingers in my pockets and pulled my pants up pretending to adjust my belt (my stupid useless belt)  I don't think the interviewer saw anything.  Disaster was averted.  Then I started to leave and the secretary giggled as she said ""I hope to see more of you in the future"", with a big obvious smirk and wink.

There's no reason for them to book more South African musicians.  I wouldn't watch a concert on television that was primarily artists I've never heard of, and I'm sure most people around the world wouldn't either.

I'm sure if FIFA were to tell it's sponsors ""We're putting on this multi-million dollar event in South Africa and the majority of the artists performing aren't ones your customers have ever heard of."" they'd laugh at them and pull out of the event.

And yes, I'm sure a lot of people dislike Alicia Keys, John Legend, and the Black Eyed Peas.  They're pop stars and that in and of itself makes their art polarizing.  But they're still popular musicians.  According to the music industry publication Pollstar, Alicia Keys sells an average of 7900 tickets a show internationally.  The biggest South African performer on the bill, Vusi Mahlasela sells closer to 200.

The most annoying and often violated of these rules are about travel. Basically Peace Corps wants to know where you are at all times in order to notify you in case of emergency in country or at home. This sounds reasonable in theory, but in practice it is pretty annoying since you have to submit prior plans for all your travel.

The thing about most of the rules is that the enforcement is kinda like the RIAA and file sharing. With only 30 staff members in an entire country, Peace Corps is very unlikely to catch a volunteer breaking the rules. As a result the penalties are set pretty high (many things can get you kicked out) in order to scare volunteers into following the rules.","1270084561"

To actually answer the question, what _is_ the reason we are in Afghanistan, I will give the only explanations that make sense to me: 1) heroin -- Drugs = money; 2) control over fossils fuels; 3) control over territory (empire); 4) human attraction to war

***1. Heroin -- Drugs = Money***

***3. Control over territory***

[Strategic rivalry and conflict between the British Empire and the Russian Empire for supremacy in Central Asia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game)

***4. Human attraction to war***

How did all of these aggressive, largely unethical motivations result in an invasion and continued occupation?  The best explanation I have heard is the theory given in the book *The Psychology of War : Comprehending Its Mystique and Its Madness*.

Basically, the idea is that 'mythical thinking' (as opposed to observation and rational  thought) makes it possible to engage in activities (wars) that solve the most basic age-old human dilemma: the conflict between self and the group.

Put yourself in the position of U.S. leaders who see all of these strategic goals in Afghanistan.

1. Blizzard never made a single game in 5 years since WoW.
2. Every Blizzard game has gotten 1 expansion, WoW gets (is getting) 3
3. I refuse to play a game where I pay 10 dollars a month
4. Blizzards upcoming titles are just rehashes of old franchises, nothing new or innovative. Same old gameplay with just fancier graphics which is great in some ways but just a way to sucker people in without taking any chances or breaking the mold. Yeah I played the SC2 beta, while it was fun it doesnt seem like the next big thing in gaming for me even though its well done if you liked SC. It is certainly not worth the long wait, and the idea of paying for maps turns me off a great deal. Fuck microtransactions.
5. Addittionally breaking the game into 3 seems like a way to pinch pennies from people. The Terran camapaign from the first SC2 game better be long.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;correct me if I'm wrong, but when has the tea party platform been to kill or shoot or maim or spread hatred? 

Explicitly?  Probably never.  I suppose we're responding to some of the tongue-in-cheek calls to action (e.g., ""if you see a subaru with an obama bumper sticker, pull it over..."").  If you have to preface every speech with ""keep in mind, I'm not actually asking you to do these things,"" you're doing it wrong ;)

&gt;my understanding is that the basic tenet they hold is one of big government vs. small government, not one of hatred. 

I think you're right, though the ""small government"" platform is not consistently applied (e.g., don't touch medicare, support a huge military, etc.).  It would be a legitimate platform, but I don't buy that it's well-represented by the Tea Party.  If it did, how would they differ from Libertarians?  Why do they need to exist, unless their platform is different?

&gt;this was the most blatant attempt for Grayson to take a cheap shot at a tea-party protester by pulling out a death threat some psycho made on his son.

I agree.  Grayson is occasionally spot-on in his criticisms of the GOP/Tea Party, but this was not one of those occasions.  Sometimes I think he crosses the line between candid honesty and silly punditry.

&gt;you can't judge an entire movement based on the insane actions of some of its members

But you can judge the movement's organizers for *denying* that those members exist, or that they have any responsibility to address them.  This is true for both left and right organizations.  If they really have a good point, there should be a way to convey it that doesn't rile up the crazies.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I'm amazed at how poorly written some of the fundamental web specs are. Here's the heart of the [spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1) for how to encode application/x-www-form-urlencoded data:

&gt; Control names and values are escaped. Space characters are replaced by `+', and then reserved characters are escaped as described in RFC1738, section 2.2: Non-alphanumeric characters are replaced by `%HH', a percent sign and two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII code of the character. Line breaks are represented as ""CR LF"" pairs (i.e., `%0D%0A').

First problem: it says to do space to '+', **then** do the %HH encoding. So given the input ""a b+c"", the first step would give ""a+b+c"" as the input to the second step.

Second problem: '+' is not a reserved character in RFCC1738, so after %HH encoding the reserved characters in ""a+b+c"", we have ""a+b+c"". Unfortunately, we'd get the same result if the initial input had been ""a+b c"". Collision!

The second problem is resolved by noting upon a second reading the it says reserved characters are escaped as described in RFC1738. That could be interpreted to mean that then escaping is as described in the RFC--not that we are supposed to be using the same set of reserved characters as the RFC uses. The reserved characters for the form encoding are the non-alphanumeric characters.

That's a little better--it will give us ""a%2Bb%2Bc"". Still a collision though.

To fix that, we've got to read

    Space characters are replaced by '+', and then reserved characters are escaped...

as meaning space characters are replaced by '+', and then any reserved characters OTHER THAN the '+'s that resulted from the space replacement are escaped.","1270084659"

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","I ran into a similar problem---not because of gardening, but trying to keep the neighbor's cat away from our window because one of our indoor cats is extremely territorial (she'd see the neighbor cat, go ballistic, and attack her brother---ahh displaced aggression). Anyway, there are three solutions I found that looked likely:

One is, most cats don't like the smell of citrus. If you can find a lemon or orange air freshener, or one of those orange oil-based cleansers or all-natural ant killers, and spray/pour a bit around the edge of your garden, it might help. I found it kept the neighbor cat off of our porch railing for a little while, although it always wore off eventually (faster if there was rain, naturally).

I found two products in stores, one was an ultrasonic doohickey you stick upright in the ground. According to consumer reviews, it has about a 50-50 success rate. I haven't tried it, so no clue from personal experience.

The other product was a canister of granules made from fox and coyote urine---the idea is that the scent of a predator marking its territory scares the cat away. It also supposedly has about a 50-50 success rate, but it's way cheaper to test out than the ultrasonic option in case it doesn't work. So far it's worked pretty well for me.

Hope that helps... I've found the orange ant-killer from organic gardening stores, and the other two products from pet stores or Amazon.","1270084670"

"math","t5_2qh0n","Shuffling is not nearly as random as you might think. There is a reason that a casino shuffles card decks many times before playing with them. If you take a new deck of cards and number each one in order from top to bottom, you have a single rising sequence 1...52. After one riffle shuffle you now have two rising sequences, interleaved (perhaps not perfectly interleaved). But in a perfect riffle shuffle (i.e. you cut the deck somewhere and interleave the two packets in a perfect alternating fashion), the only thing that varies is the point where you cut the deck and which packet you start dropping. So there are really only 102 distinct ""perfect"" riffle shuffles (and most people tend to cut the deck somewhere near the middle, I have allowed for cutting anywhere). Far from random.

There actually is some serious math behind studying the ""randomness"" of shuffling card. TTamm linked to an expository paper on that subject. You have to begin with two concepts. First, how do you know how far a probability distribution is from being uniform? The standard notion of distance in this context is the ""total variation distance"", which is basically where given two probability measures p, m, their total variation distance is the supremum over all possible events A of |p(A) - m(A)|. So it measures basically how bad they differ in the worst case.

The second concept involved is that of a Markov chain. Basically a markov chain is a stochastic process such that the conditional probabilities (conditioned on the entire history of the process) are equal to those conditioned on the current state. I.e. you don't need to know the past if you know where you are right now. A lot of natural probability problems involve a markov structure. In this case, when shuffling cards a bunch of time, you don't really need to keep track of *how* you shuffled in the past, as long as you know the current probability distribution on the possible decks of cards (and your method of shuffling is consistent between shuffles -- this is a convenient approximation to reality). You'll notice that I keep using the phrase ""probability distribution"", which is really what we are talking about. Your sample space is the space of all permutations of 52 cards. The initial distribution is singular, we know when we start with a fresh deck that it is ordered in a particular way. So the probability of that permutation is 1 and the probability of anything else is 0. As we shuffle a few times, we are stepping along a markov chain, and after each step we have a new probability distribution: take the old one and update it given our model of shuffling. It is part of the theory of markov chains that they typically have a ""stationary"" distribution in the limit, i.e. a distribution invariant under steps, and one that the initial distribution converges to if we were to take an infinite number of steps. In this case the assertion is that the stationary distribution is uniform (I think) and the question is now a matter of how rapidly the initial distribution converges to that (convergence in total variation norm).

This lead to the discovery of what is called the cutoff phenomena. If you've ever heard that you need 7 shuffles to ""properly""  randomize a deck of cards, you might naturally assume that if you shuffle once then result is 1/7 as random. It turns out this is not true... the first few riffle shuffles are not as effective as the next few, and then after a bunch you are just wasting your time. If you were to visualize a graph of the total variation distance from the uniform distribution, it would look sort of like a logistic decay... i.e. slow decay at the beginning and then exponential decay in some critical period of time, then back to slow decay. This is an example of a phase transition and this sort of stuff is a hot field for probabilists, because markov chains are everywhere and a lot of them exhibit such a cutoff property.

If you are into probability and you want a book on this subject,check out ""Markov Chains and Mixing Times"". It's accessible to anyone with an intro probability course (although you have to be willing to put in the work).","1270084705"

"depression","t5_2qqqf","First off - Yay!  I'm glad you're feeling better.  Isn't this what we all want - To feel OK, to not feel depressed and burdened by compulsions, anxieties, fears, etc.?

Secondly, I'm glad to hear you're a dude.  'Cause I was feeling slightly creepy talking nice to (what I thought was a) female sex addict.  Being that you're a guy, I do hope you know that at least some of what you've described (lots of masturbation, seeking out wild sex scenarios, lots of partners) is sort of normal for a male your age.  I think the most important things to keep in mind here is threefold: 1. wear a condom so you don't hurt yourself with a disease, 2. stop beating yourself up so much for having sexual impulses and 3. find out what else besides basic hormones is driving your libido.

I'm glad to hear that your psychiatrist knows about the sex addiction, maybe you can talk to him about broaching the topic with your psychologist (therapist).  I certainly hope that you talk about your alcohol drinking with both of them.

I don't want to be a dick here, but here's a friendly reminder that alcohol can actually kill you.  I grew up across the street from a family that was destroyed by alcoholism.  The parents got divorced, and then the son became an alcoholic and committed suicide, and shortly afterwards the father drank himself to death.  One family - totally destroyed by alcohol.  Fuuuuuuu.  Sad, sad, sad.

I hope that you talk to both your psychologist and psychiatrist about your drinking and weed use.  At a minimum, you owe it to the psychiatrist to know these things so that he has a decent chance of prescribing the right medication to you.  

Well, whether  you decide to talk about your sex addiction to the therapist you already know well, or talk about it in a group of mostly strangers, it sounds to me like you're getting to be OK with talking about it.  I can certainly tell that you have some concerns about being thought of as a weirdo (or some kind of monster, I can't tell which), but taking the risk of talking about it in a therapeutic environment seems like a your odds of getting a negative response are low.  I certainly hope that your kinks are only related to adults and not to minors 'cause well.... I have another story about a former neighbor who destroyed his life because he was a pedophile.  Well, whatever the specific kinks you're into, it's better to get some help and get it off your chest around people you can trust and can expect to react in a mature, helpful way about things.

I hope that instead of letting your mind run off with self-criticism, that you'll be able to interrupt your thoughts or at least count the number of times you have self-critical thoughts.  Simply recognizing the thought as they happen (I know this is somewhat difficult because you can't both think a thought and be aware of the thought at the same time) or just immediately after they happen is a good practice to get into.  And when you start to notice that your mind becomes an endless spring of self-criticism, you can start to tell yourself, ""here we go again, I should really try to think of something more positive"" or ""oh, these negative thoughts are so tedious and depressing, they're so non-constructive and harmful.  It would be nice if I could think of almost anything else.""  Just simply recognizing your self-critical thoughts as they happen (or shortly thereafter) - as opposed to getting lost in them - will be so much better for you.  I know you have it in you to change your thinking and to separate your thoughts from yourself and to objectify your thoughts as separate from yourself.  That way, hopefully, you won't feel so depressed and brought down by all these self-critical thoughts and you won't feel the need to drink or smoke weed to the point of blacking out.

I'm sure you know that drugging until you black out is not going to work out for you in the long run.  No need to lecture there.  I hate to see you in pain like this and I hope you can find ways to interrupt whatever train of negative or self-critical thoughts may be brewing.  

As for your ""failings"" think about this - the history of philosophy is littered with failures and failed thinking.  Even the most brilliant people fail - and repeatedly too.  The important thing (you know what I'm going to say, I know you do) is that you keep trying.  Give yourself some credit and make note of the progress you've made.  Perhaps you should think about the myth of Sisyphus.  The Greek story of the man who was doomed to roll a rock uphill for all eternity.  So what if you never get to this (overly-)romanticized goal of perfection?  The most amazing thing about you is you have the strength to keep picking yourself up and dusting yourself off over and over again.  That's what makes you strong.

Anyway, I'm sorry if I've been sounding preachy, I don't mean to be a dickhole.  I know that in my personal life I have to deal with my unipolar depression - which is its own trial.  So I hope you don't think I'm talking down to you.  We all have our own stones to roll uphill.  I hope you'll consider some of my suggestions.  And more importantly, I hope you have continued success and continued will to fight the good fight.  Good luck!!","1270084717"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;Actually that's a pretty solid argument.

Actually it's a really weak argument.  Sony can not be responsible for people breaking their system and using it in a way other than intended.   

I can say ""You can only sell my book if there are no mustaches drawn on my picture"" but if someone buys it and then draws a mustache on my picture you are not in violation of anything.

I honestly can't tell why people are constantly going so far to defend a company watching it's bottom line at it's customers cost (even if that customer group is relatively small).

Why is Sony doing this?  The *realistic* options are:

They are aware of or strongly suspect and want to preempt possible piracy via this hack.  At this point this hack cannot enable piracy but if Sony has reason to believe it will turn into that, that is a very strong reason for them to do it. 

Secondly if this allows access to the full graphics card, this poses a direct threat to their online game sales devision.  This is a source of profit for them and they want to protect themselves from potential loss of revenue in this area. 

Or any of many other possibilities.   None of which is contractual obligation to certain use of the video processor.

Now why any of these reasons should be swalled by *US* the consumer as ok is beyond me... ""Sony needs to keep making money so stop being unhappy something is taken from you!"".  Why is that rational so prevalent and accepted?

If this was some person doing this to you you wouldn't defend them.  Joe Schome down the block sells you a bike, then weeks later takes back the sprocket because he is afraid letting you keep it might cost him money down the road.  Would you say ""Oh really, you might suffer a loss?   Well that's ok, I will suffer the loss so you don't have to"".  

WTF people?  Seriously we go out of our way to defend coorporations like this?  The same ones who sell us crappier and crappier products anyway (a whole nother rant is that it's no apparently normal practice to buy an extended warranty, people don't think ""Well if it breaks I will be protected"" now I hear ""when it breaks I will be glad it only cost me $30 to get a new one!"" as if somehow the expectation that needed to pay extra to protect your shoddy product is ok).

And all the arguments of ""but they give you free updates and new features for free so why is it so bad to take something away?"" is flawed logic.  Sure I like getting free updates and improvements, but that's not what I bought and if you choose to give me something hey that's cool with me!  But you aren't buying somme kind of credit to screw me on the back end somewhere.  That's the whole deal with giving something for free, it's not a loan that has to be repaid later and it's not an obligation or coupon to redeem something in return.

Giving and taking are not linked like some kind of see saw or math equation.  I didn't buy a promised equation of gifts to theft.  I bought a certain set of things and you are free to give me anything else you want on top of that but I have every right to not want to give you anything I bought back.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","You have fallacious partisan ideas to base your words on.

At the very least, to be consistent, you need to break it up into social, fiscal and foreign policy areas.  In general, in the US, conservatives are for more government in social and foreign policy areas, while want less government in fiscal areas.  On the other end, liberals generally want less government involvement in social and foreign issues, and more government in fiscal areas.

But even this over simplifies the political spectrum on a linear scale.  There are some conservatives (libertarians) who want less government in social and/or foreign policies as well, and there are probably some war hawkish liberals.  At the *very* lest you'd need to describe this on a 2D axis scale to be somewhat accurate and not to drastically over simply things like you did.

Edit: The confusion comes because in general, conservatives want to keep things the way they are (to conserve).  That means, depending on the country and time, ""conservative"" can mean very different things.  That's why in general, a social conservative tends to refer to the religious right.","1270084755"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Thank you, your response has touched me emotionally. I send my love as well. ^_^ I would be honored to have you write a song about my experiences. :)

I once recreated most of my recurring hallucinations in the sims 2 it was really trippy to look at. I haven't felt quite confident enough in my drawing abilities to draw any of them though. Plus the further I get from those memories the less I remember just what they looked like. It's like knowing someone but never having taken any pictures of them, over time you still remember the feelings they invoked in you, but lesser so their physical appearance.

I've certainly thought pretty much exactly what you just said. It's something I still wonder about. It's hard to know a whole set of people and then have people tell you they're just hallucinations, or figments of my imagination, or any of the numerous theories people have.

Psychosis is certainly interesting, and I've wanted on many occasions to slowly go back into it and analyze it. However it is a dangerous state of mind, and there are many terrible terrible experiences to be had as well. It's taken a long time to turn it into something I can look back on objectively and without bursting into tears over.

Speaking of songs, I wrote a set of acoustic guitar songs while in my apartment during the early stages of my recovery. If you're interested at all in the emotional insight those have, they can be found here:

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So some friends and me were at this festival and camped there for 3 days. While not a pure rock festival, a lot more guys then girls were present. At a festival people are not the people they normally are. The guys near our place screamed for straight 3 days ""tits"" and then ""show them to us"" whenever a girl (no matter how she looked) walked near them, I bet that they don't do something like this at home. 

It was funny the first day and then got boring to us, but I recognized an interesting pattern: No matter how stupid you approach a woman, there is *always* a success rate. After trying literally 100 times they got their tits for a few seconds. 

Because all the guys tried harder and harder, it got difficult to approach women in an usual way. 

What we did, after studying the ""tittis"" experiment around the corner: we build 4 signs: ""What's"" ""your"" ""name?"" "":)"". The backside of ""name?"" could be turned around, so that it read ""number?"".

We approached a lot of women and groups of women as a group of males. It had nothing to do with how they looked and I had not the feeling that bad looking girls could be approached easier. So most girls were cute. Some of them just gave out their number. Some smiled, some didn't. Girls huged us eventhough we met some seconds ago, just to get the attention of an official fotographer and a neat foto with us. Some just walked away. Some wanted to have a drink with us later this evening. By switching the signs intentionally, so that it read ""your"" ""name"" ""what's"", nearly every girl smiled and pointed out the obvious and we got a higher ""success rate"". 

We had a lot of fun and by trying a lot, our tent was no more a guy's only tent.

In the end, it's all about trying alot. The signs also helped to try it more than once and not to feel ashamed after a failed approach.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","My answer to another thread asking ""why do you do drugs,"" but it works as an endorsement of pot as well:

As many drugs as I have done, I am still a stoner at heart. Nothing speaks to me like pot does. It helps me push my thoughts beyond what boundaries are still left after ten years of using it. Pot has helped me think critically, write poetry, write academic essays, have gorgeous conversations, play music beyond my standard prowess, experience music played by others beyond my standard prowess, and have completely amazing sex.

Though, what it really really does for me... that can be conveyed in the following anecdote.

All throughout high school I was very much against drugs. I hated the way they were used to define people in a cliquish sort of sense. I felt I was above them. At the same time, I felt very much the outcast throughout high school. I felt as if I was seeking something, something I once had as a child but now lost. No one quite saw the world the way I did or valued the same things I did and I felt very alone.

The summer after I graduated high school, I decided to try pot, just to see, so I knew I wasn't doing it to be cool or make friends, I just wanted to see... and I saw a lot.

Though it wasnt until my third time maybe that I fell in love. I walked out on a secluded road smoking a joint and suddenly found myself stoned. Above me were the leafless tree branches and beyond them the cold and clear stars of a January night. I decided to turn back home and as I walked I kept my eyes on the sky. Each step passed beneath me almost subliminally. I was floating and drifting, sailing through the stars. I was transfixed and I had found what I was looking for.

That sense of awe and wonder: I have always felt it, even before drugs, that stirring in me, what poets like Coleridge and Shelley and Keats describe; I felt it long before pot, but I felt it maybe twenty miles away, and pot put me within in inches of It... The Thing.... whatever it might be... The Nameless ... ""the soul of each and the God of all"" as Coleridge puts it.

And that's how and why I use drugs to this day. They peel back social narratives. They peel away the stories we tell ourselves about reality on a daily basis and for those hours I spend stoned and walking out in the world, I can see the raw beauty of everything; I can see with eyes unclouded.

"politics","t5_2cneq","(I know you didn't ask me but,) I agree with everything Sotonohito said, and maybe I might be able to fill in some blanks. As far as I recall, what Tim McVeigh did was kind of a jawdropping moment; while not nearly to the extent 9-11 was, it put the right-wing militia conspiracy-driven fringe in a very stark light that was indefensible to all but themselves. [This was the iconic image](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Firefighterbabyocb.jpg) of what McVeigh did; any movement that results in producing a photo like that loses all legitimacy in the eyes of the vast majority (at least for a while). There were other attacks from that same fringe (Eric Rudolph at the Olympics in Atlanta being the most notorious), but the attacks and the climate of violent rhetoric calmed quite a bit after Oklahoma City in 1995. 

And to the question of whether the rhetoric was as bad in the lead-up to what McVeigh did in 1995 as it is now: I'd say yeah, the rhetoric itself was very similar in vitriol and just as over the top in its claims. There is one very important (and troubling) difference between then and now. Back then, the violence-prone fringe of the right-wing wasn't really connected to the rest of the right-wing and definitely not connected to any major politicians, major financial and media backers, etc. They had no Sarah Palin, no Dick Armey organizing rallies, no ""Tea Party,"" no Fox News, overall they didn't have an input into the poltical process like now, and didn't really shape the political landscape like now. 

As for why this is, I don't know. Perhaps the right wing felt they could win back power with mainstream ideas (via Gingrich) and so they didn't need to resort what they're doing now. I suspect demographic shift is part of this, demographically the Democrats have more of an advantage now than they did 15 years ago, and Republicans are at a demographic disadvantage now compared to then; so perhaps it's desperation that leads them to tapping these fringe people who previously have been outside the political process. I don't know.

I went back to my high school for my senior year and took three classes, early dismissal to go to work. I was in a chef apprenticeship that ended up not working out. Fortunately, I got so bored that I gave community college a try. I loved it! Now I have an IT degree and I work as a computer programmer and database administrator.

Addendum: I don't feel the slightest bit embarrassed about my catastrophic high school career, but I have found that I get some very perplexed looks from some of the people I have met who were high achievers when it comes up.

"compsci","t5_2qhmr","Church, Turing, and Kleene had three different formalisms for expressing universal computation. Turing had his machines, which imperatively proceed from one state to the next. Church had the lambda calculus, which considers functions themselves as first-class values, to be manipulated and passed to other functions. And Kleene had more traditional recursive functions that could be composed in specific ways to yield any computable function.

Each of these formalisms is capable of simulating the other two, so they are all equivalent in power. By the Church-Turing thesis, any of them should be sufficient to express any effectively computable procedure.
Under Kleene's formalisms, there are three kinds of super simple functions: identity


I'll skip over Turing machine and lambda calculus, and just outline how the [recursive functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-recursive_function) work.

You start with three basic kinds of functions:

* constant functions that return a fixed value,

* the success function that increments its argument, and

* projection functions that pick a value out of a tuple.

Then you subject these basic functions to three kinds of operators:

* composition that pipelines one function's output into another one's input,

* primitive recursion that enables iteration, and

* minimization that allows possibly unbounded iteration.

Using these operators, we can construct bigger and better functions that handle arithmetic and control structures. Then we simulate a Turing machine and get its state on the nth step. Finally, using minimization, we find the state of the machine on the smallest step such that it has halted.

The recursive function that simulates the universal Turing machine in this manner is also capable of universal computation.","1270084865"

The fact that retailers will gladly give you a refund - even if you have made an improper decision - is evidence that it isn't profitable at least some of the time.

You'll notice that I never claimed it happens all the time, just that it happens often. Often is, of course, not a very scientific term and I'll accept any lashings I get for not having the data on precisely how often corporations hide data, but even if it's rarely the results can still be catastrophic. See: DDT, Agent Orange, BGH, or just about anything that Monsanto is popularly known for.

In an open field, cavalry is going to win every time, since the gunners will only get one shot before the cavalry eats them.

Yes, that's why I pointed out the necessary conclusion that your logic implies.

Yes, that is the point I addressed.  

Is the adult on the ventilator inside a womb?  No.

Is the adult on the ventilator able to survive without extraordinary means?  No.

Therefore by your argument the adult has no right to life.

It's really very simple and if you were familiar with the workings of even a basic syllogism you would probably understand very quickly.

&gt; An adult isn't developing in a womb. 

Yes, neither is the baby that we are talking about, as you yourself have already stated multiple times: ""the point is when it can survive **outside the womb**""...""It can't survive **outside the womb**"".  I'm amazed at how quickly you lost track of your own argument.

Both the baby and the adult are outside of a womb if they are on life support, and neither the baby nor the adult can survive without the extraordinary means of life support.  They are both identical in terms of the only two criteria you have thus far mentioned, and therefore have the exact same rights based on those criteria.  Therefore, by this standard, they are either both killable or unkillable, unless you would like to modify your logic.  As I already mentioned: If you want to say they are different, you've got to actually make a logical case for that.","1270085014"

Once at the top, I proceeded to drink all three beers and drop the cans on the ground, telling myself that I would pick them up when I got to the bottom. I started to climb down and stopped on a branch about 10 ft up. That's when I blacked out. When I woke up, I was walking down a street I had never been on. Totally lost, of course I didn't bring my phone on this mission. So I wandered for about 2 hours in the dead of night trying to figure out where the fuck I was. I got desperate enough to sit in someone's yard and cry for a bit at one point. As it got later, I was starting to get really really cold, so I started looking for shelter. I found my way into a church. Finally, I found my way to the third floor where I found a phone. I called my girlfriend....no answer. I left a message ""Honey I'm lost in Atlanta (I was in Macon) I need you to come and get me."" (Remember I'm still hammered here). I called a second time, this time more desperate "" Please pick up the phone, I'm really lost and I don't know what to do."" Third call, crying. ""Please pick up the phone!!! I'm so, so scared (sob,sob)."" She didn't pick up the phone because it was 4AM. So I finally wander out of the church, after stopping for a minute in the main area to ask if God would help me get home just this once. As the sun is comming up, I finally find some people who can tell me where the fucking magnolia tree is and from there I get back to my friend's place. Everyone's response is OMG what the fuck happened to your face? When I blacked out in the tree, I fell 10 ft and hit my fucking face on the ground. So, of course on the way back to Athens, we have to stop at my friend's house to have dinner with her parents, AWESOME. They all want to know why the fuck I have bandaides on my face so I just fucking tell them that I climbed a tree and blacked out b/c I was drinking in it and fell. I missed class for the next 3 days while I healed. My girlfriend kept those phone messages and laughed at me for 6 months. I later married her and love her to this day. 

tl;dr: I got piss drunk, thought I should climb a tree and continue to drink, then blacked out and fell out of that tree, woke up lost, left three pathetic phone messages at my most desperate hour which I got to hear played back for me repeatedly over the next six months. ","1270085021"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I feel like should have been born around like 1950. I'm pretty sure around 1948-1952 is the most awesome time to be born so far. 

Think about it, you'd get to go to elementary school during the late-50s, which is a pretty classic time-period. You'd be right around the same age as the Sandlot kids (12ish during the early 60s), a pretty carefree time in America to be a kid. 

You'd hit your teenage years right around the hippie era, and be a young-adult around the Vietnam era, so you could be right in the middle of the protests and upheaval and stuff. 

You'd have gotten to seen JFK, Johnson, Nixon, etc... first-hand. You'd hit middle age right around the tech-boom, in time to get into the computer revolution and not be left in the dust like the previous generation.

You'd have gotten to see the civil rights fight first-hand. 

You'd be coming up on 60 right now, which means you still got a good 20-30 years left on the planet (if you're lucky that is), and at the rate history is going, there's gonna be tons of shit going down over the next few decades. I feel bad for people born in like the 30s or 40s, they're gonna miss out on some epic scientific breakthroughs here in the next decade or two.

I dunno, I just think that'd be an awesome ""window"" of history to get to experience. 1950-2030 seems like a pretty kick-ass chunk of history to get to see. 

I was born in the 80s. So ~1985-2065 might be a pretty cool chunk of history too, because who knows what's gonna happen between now and 2065. Maybe it'll blow the 1960s and 1970s out of the water.

But so far, I think 1950-2030 would be the best. I think the 80s and 90s were kinda boring, compared to the 60s and 70s. 

To be honest, the thought of like 2030, 2040, 2050, etc... scares the CRAP out of me. Like think about it, 2050 is gonna be so radically different than now, it freaks me right the fuck out.

&gt; When you approach me in public, you are Schrödinger’s Rapist. You may or may not be a man who would commit rape.  

If she applied Schrödinger’s theories properly then she would know that it's not that the man *may* or *may not* be a rapist, it's that the man *is* and *is not* a rapist.  At the same time.  Only by engaging the man (that is, by opening the box) might he be seen as either one or the other.  Until it is revealed, he is simultaneously guilty and innocent.  By this logic, it is not 1 in 60 strangers that is a rapist, it is 100% of strangers that are rapists.  Clearly, then, her fear is justified by an unquestionable rate of statistical significance.  Her fear is also absurd, because by the same logic of her thesis, not a single stranger in the world is a rapist.  Not a single one.  She's logic-bombed herself into the realm of paranoia.  This is not progressive.  This is not feminism.  This is fear.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I was with you until about the middle of your second sentence. Up until that, I presumed you, like me, couldn't understand why the CofC would want work against the interests of a majority of it's members. But then you veered off into something entirely different.

Haven't you heard that the new health care law immediately provides tax breaks for small businesses? Either you're spectacularly misinformed or you're just spouting inaccurate propaganda. [Read this.](http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/how-the-health-care-law-affects-your-business/) 

An excerpt:

&gt;From 2010 through 2013 — before, that is, health insurance exchanges are established — a very small business will receive a tax credit to offset 35 percent of their health insurance costs, provided the business contributes at least half of the premium. Then, once the business begins buying insurance through an exchange, the credit increases to 50 percent and is available for any two consecutive years. The full credit is available to businesses with the equivalent of 10 or fewer full-time workers paid, on average, less than $25,000; it phases out as the payroll, excluding seasonal workers, grows to 25 and wages rise to $50,000.

&gt;The Small Business Majority, a liberal-leaning organization that lobbied for health care reform along the lines of the new law, hopes to install a tax credit calculator on its Web site as soon as it can sort out the details of the legislation, according to Terry Gardiner, the organization’s national policy director.

And note particularly as you read it that the *size* of the business makes a great deal of difference in terms of what will be expected of any particular business. I am no expert on the bill, but from what I've read, the really small businesses, who perhaps genuinely cannot afford to provide insurance for their few employees, won't be expected to do so. But giants like Walmart won't be able to foist off what should be their responsibilities on the rest of us (had you read that a substantial number of Walmart employees are so poorly paid that they qualify for medicaid and therefore get their health care through the state instead of receiving insurance from Walmart?)","1270085064"

When there's a girl I'm interested in, I follow them the best that I can. There are plenty of reasons it won't work out even if you do follow the rules. But the rules aren't about relationships, they're about meeting people and having people want to see you again.

If I were to write three rules for girls to follow, they might look like: (off the top of my head, but it probably won't stop the flames from coming) 

1) Take care of your appearance and have a ""look"" that compliments your features. (Be attractive.)
2) Don't be a bitch. (Don't be unattractive.)
3) Be fun to be around. (Be charming.)

If a girl is having trouble attracting men, she's probably breaking one of those three. There's plenty of girls of Reddit who moan that they can't find any good men, and usually focus on the wrong reasons. If they follow those three, they will have no problem attracting good men to be their boyfriends/SOs/whatevers, though like everyone, they will run into some duds along the way.","1270085071"

As the partner who has female friends, you always have to stay in touch with your feelings and behavior so you don't give any mixed signals to anyone.

Eventually, over time, we grew comfortable with our lifestyle together.  From my work with clients, I would say 1) help her probe her thoughts that come up when these events happen (challenge the thoughts that are not factually-based but don't put her down); 2) decide how important the relationship is to you because your SO IS most important but ""being true to myself"" as you put it is also important.  So you are weighing what is most important.  

And 3) give all this time.  Jealousy often works itself out over time if both partners are trustworthy as it sounds like you are being.  Some tension will remain in the relationship until this works out.  Obviously if she goes into rage mode, you will be forced to make a choice.","1270085099"

Adults, the more mature ones can talk to each other about sex without awkwardness and embarassment. 

Children can talk to each other about sex, but there's a lot more giggling and a lot less coherence.  It gets really weird when adults try to explain sex to kids and even more so if they're not French or Italian.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Bloodline champions is very similar to World of warcraft arenas except much less balance issues and no gear. It's fast based strategic game play. I've been in the beta for about three weeks and I can confidently say it's way more balanced than the competitors. When a game is strictly pvp, it's much easier to balance. That's why WoW arenas, HoN and League of legends were so tedious. Players could farm pve and it would give a huge advantage in pvp. In world of warcraft the players needed tons of amazing gear just to compete and not to mention classes being buffed and nerfed almost constantly to try and balance pve with pvp. The bloodline matches last about 30 seconds to a min each and it's (in some cases it takes longer) and it's usually best of 5 in which a team is declared the winner. If you enjoyed world of warcraft arenas and the pvp side of HoN, Dota and League of legends then you'll love bloodline.

I volunteered for teaching gifted elementary and middle school students math concepts on the weekends at college.  We did things like set and game theory, and inductive vs. deductive logic.

What I really enjoyed, though, was teaching algebra to at-risk middle- and high-schoolers.  I started doing it as part of community service credits required by my college, and found it incredibly fulfilling.  Given the job prospects locally in programming, I was planning on going into teaching (using NC's instant certification, where you start teaching immediately and get your educator's degree in parallel).  Our state is desparate for math teachers in primary school.

Then the No Child Left Behind Act got passed.  The instant certification plan was no longer allowable, since NCLBA required ""certified educators"".  I didn't have the money to spend another 2-3 years in school to get a new degree.  So I went into the industry.

I don't know which group was affected more by NCLBA, crappy unqualified teachers, or enthusiastic unqualified teachers (that could very well have serious knowledge qualifications, just not a teacher's license).

In small villages where volunteers mostly live there is a heavy pressure on females to dress conservatively. Conservative dress was encouraged by the Peace Corps in order to help with cultural integration which is a major goal for volunteers. 

Relationships: Again there is some social pressure on females to not appear promiscuous in any way but Peace Corps does not have any rules about this. There are however rules about getting married to a Moroccan. Basically you have to inform Peace Corps and get married within in a six month window in your service.

Affiliations: I think you mean the people you hang out with? There are no specific rules about this but it kinda falls under the umbrella of representing Peace Corps and the United States in a positive way. For example if you hang out with the guys selling hash all the time then people are going to see you as ""the American who always smokes hash"" and Peace Corps isn't going to like that even if you don't actually smoke hash.

"programming","t5_2fwo","The problem is that bundling _in itself_ can be regarded as anticompetitive.

Let's imagine for a moment that Microsoft develops a new, advanced text editor (let's just call it ""product Z"") that competes with UltraEdit, Notepad++, and the like. If Microsoft bundles product Z with Windows, it means they're using their gigantic marketshare in Windows to gain a foothold in the text editor market. Since product Z is bundled with Windows, everyone who buys Windows is also forced to buy product Z, giving them an unfair advantage.

Of course, a consumer OS can't exactly ship without some form of text editor. But the line between ""rudimentary text editor providing core functionality"" and ""market competitor"" can be blurry. That's what I meant when I said it's a ""grey area"" - it can be hard to define what you can and can't bundle in an OS without running afoul of anticompetition laws.","1270085378"

No, that's not the way words work - though it would be possible for a shift in the meaning of the word to take place, you as an individual do not have the power to effect that shift yourself.

Not at all - only on the basis of your definition of 'atheist' which is essentially the question under discussion.

Measure 6: you have a direct octave in bass and alto.  Maybe have the bass drop to the low A instead?  Also, measure 7, chord 2: I'd switch the alto and soprano notes, E on top, G below.

Two days later, on Saturday morning, I arose, a tottering wreck, and went forth to fulfil an engagement with a valued friend, the Rev. Mr.------, to walk to the Talcott Tower, ten miles distant. He stared at me, but asked no questions. We started. Mr.------ talked, talked, talked as is his wont. I said nothing; I heard nothing. At the end of a mile, Mr.------ said ""Mark, are you sick? I never saw a man look so haggard and worn and absent-minded. Say something, do!""

Drearily, without enthusiasm, I said: ""Punch brothers, punch with care! Punch in the presence of the passenjare!""

My friend eyed me blankly, looked perplexed, they said:

""I do not think I get your drift, Mark. Then does not seem to be any relevancy in what you have said, certainly nothing sad; and yet--maybe it was the way you said the words--I never heard anything that sounded so pathetic. What is--""

But I heard no more. I was already far away with my pitiless, heartbreaking ""blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, pink trip slip for a three-cent fare; punch in the presence of the passenjare."" I do not know what occurred during the other nine miles. However, all of a sudden Mr.------ laid his hand on my shoulder and shouted:

""Oh, wake up! wake up! wake up! Don't sleep all day! Here we are at the Tower, man! I have talked myself deaf and dumb and blind, and never got a response. Just look at this magnificent autumn landscape! Look at it! look at it! Feast your eye on it! You have traveled; you have seen boaster landscapes elsewhere. Come, now, deliver an honest opinion. What do you say to this?""

I sighed wearily; and murmured:

""A buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, a pink trip slip for a three-cent fare, punch in the presence of the passenjare.""

Rev. Mr. ------ stood there, very grave, full of concern, apparently, and looked long at me; then he said:

""Mark, there is something about this that I cannot understand. Those are about the same words you said before; there does not seem to be anything in them, and yet they nearly break my heart when you say them. Punch in the--how is it they go?""

I began at the beginning and repeated all the lines.

My friend's face lighted with interest. He said:

""Why, what a captivating jingle it is! It is almost music. It flows along so nicely. I have nearly caught the rhymes myself. Say them over just once more, and then I'll have them, sure.""

I said them over. Then Mr. ------ said them. He made one little mistake, which I corrected. The next time and the next he got them right. Now a great burden seemed to tumble from my shoulders. That torturing jingle departed out of my brain, and a grateful sense of rest and peace descended upon me. I was light-hearted enough to sing; and I did sing for half an hour, straight along, as we went jogging homeward. Then my freed tongue found blessed speech again, and the pent talk of many a weary hour began to gush and flow. It flowed on and on, joyously, jubilantly, until the fountain was empty and dry. As I wrung my friend's hand at parting, I said:

""Haven't we had a royal good time! But now I remember, you haven't said a word for two hours. Come, come, out with something!""

The Rev. Mr.------ turned a lack-luster eye upon me, drew a deep sigh, and said, without animation, without apparent consciousness:

""Punch, brothers, punch with care! Punch in the presence of the passenjare!"" 

A pang shot through me as I said to myself, ""Poor fellow, poor fellow! he has got it, now.""

I did not see Mr.------ for two or three days after that. Then, on Tuesday evening, he staggered into my presence and sank dejectedly into a seat. He was pale, worn; he was a wreck. He lifted his faded eyes to my face and said:

""Ah, Mark, it was a ruinous investment that I made in those heartless rhymes. They have ridden me like a nightmare, day and night, hour after hour, to this very moment. Since I saw you I have suffered the torments of the lost. Saturday evening I had a sudden call, by telegraph, and took the night train for Boston. The occasion was the death of a valued old friend who had requested that I should preach his funeral sermon. I took my seat in the cars and set myself to framing the discourse. But I never got beyond the opening paragraph; for then the train started and the car-wheels began their 'clack, clack-clack-clack-clack! clack-clack! --clack-clack-clack!' and right away those odious rhymes fitted themselves to that accompaniment. For an hour I sat there and set a syllable of those rhymes to every separate and distinct clack the car-wheels made. Why, I was as fagged out, then, as if I had been chopping wood all day. My skull was splitting with headache. It seemed to me that I must go mad if I sat there any longer; so I undressed and went to bed. I stretched myself out in my berth, and--well, you know what the result was. The thing went right along, just the same. 'Clack-clack clack, a blue trip slip, clack-clack-clack, for an eight cent fare; clack-clack-clack, a buff trip slip, clack clack-clack, for a six-cent fare, and so on, and so on, and so on punch in the presence of the passenjare!' Sleep? Not a single wink! I was almost a lunatic when I got to Boston. Don't ask me about the funeral. I did the best I could, but every solemn individual sentence was meshed and tangled and woven in and out with 'Punch, brothers, punch with care, punch in the presence of the passenjare.' And the most distressing thing was that my delivery dropped into the undulating rhythm of those pulsing rhymes, and I could actually catch absent-minded people nodding time to the swing of it with their stupid heads. And, Mark, you may believe it or not, but before I got through the entire assemblage were placidly bobbing their heads in solemn unison, mourners, undertaker, and all. The moment I had finished, I fled to the anteroom in a state bordering on frenzy. Of course it would be my luck to find a sorrowing and aged maiden aunt of the deceased there, who had arrived from Springfield too late to get into the church. She began to sob, and said:

""'Oh, oh, he is gone, he is gone, and I didn't see him before he died!'

""'Yes!' I said, 'he is gone, he is gone, he is gone--oh, will this suffering never cease!'

""'You loved him, then! Oh, you too loved him!'

""'Loved him! Loved who?'

""'Why, my poor George! my poor nephew!'

""'Oh--him! Yes--oh, yes, yes. Certainly--certainly. Punch--punch--oh, this misery will kill me!'

""'Bless you! bless you, sir, for these sweet words! I, too, suffer in this dear loss. Were you present during his last moments?'

""'Yes. I--whose last moments?'

""'His. The dear departed's.'

""'Yes! Oh, yes--yes--yes! I suppose so, I think so, I don't know! Oh, certainly--I was there I was there!'

""'Oh, what a privilege! what a precious privilege! And his last words --oh, tell me, tell me his last words! What did he say?'

""'He said--he said--oh, my head, my head, my head! He said--he said--he never said anything but Punch, punch, punch in the presence of the passenjare! Oh, leave me, madam! In the name of all that is generous, leave me to my madness, my misery, my despair!--a buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, a pink trip slip for a three-cent fare--endu--rance can no fur--ther go!--PUNCH in the presence of the passenjare!""

My friend's hopeless eyes rested upon mine a pregnant minute, and then he said impressively:

""Mark, you do not say anything. You do not offer me any hope. But, ah me, it is just as well--it is just as well. You could not do me any good. The time has long gone by when words could comfort me. Something tells me that my tongue is doomed to wag forever to the jigger of that remorseless jingle. There--there it is coming on me again: a blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, a buff trip slip for a--""

Thus murmuring faint and fainter, my friend sank into a peaceful trance and forgot his sufferings in a blessed respite.

How did I finally save him from an asylum? I took him to a neighboring university and made him discharge the burden of his persecuting rhymes into the eager ears of the poor, unthinking students. How is it with them, now? The result is too sad to tell. Why did I write this article? It was for a worthy, even a noble, purpose. It was to warn you, reader, if you should came across those merciless rhymes, to avoid them--avoid them as you would a pestilence.","1270085417"

By ""awkward dudes"" you mean normal males who are not homosexual or veteran players. The ""push/pull of social interaction"" is bullshit pseudo-psychological explanation you've created to rationalize nonsensical female behavior.

Men have to continually show women that they can exist without them. It is a game, and a stupid one, but something in female psychology requires it. It is a entirely farcical, superficial, and macho show that is part of the human mating dance.

There is absolutely nothing rationally inferior about a man who is interested in you showing active interest. But since women are programmed to respond to this ritual, men have no choice but to robotically follow along. I don't mean to sound sexist, as men have plenty of their own irrational tendencies.

There are many successful poly relationships but most people realize they are oriented that way so go into a relationship with that on the table. You are already in an established monogamous relationship so that would necessitate establishing a whole new relationship with your current partner.

This is one way to do it.

You shouldn't worry about medicare  not controlling costs.
Medicare DOES control costs per procedure better than any other plan.
It pays far less to doctors and hospitals than any other insurance in America  due to their sheer size and negotiating power and the fact that hospitals rely on medicare as a huge portion of the volume of their business even if it isn't as profitable - it is still hugely profitable because of the volume. (The threat of decertifiying a hospital as a medicare provider is enough to instantly get compliance on health matters from any hospital and is a tool widely used by us health oversight groups.)

I thought for maybe a moment all this ""OMG BLIZZARD IS GOING TO DIE"" was hyperbole and it probably is to a certain extent unless Activision really fucks up. But after researching this guy and the new structure at ActiBlizz is made me really sad as I think it'll have an effect on the atmosphere of Blizzard. 

I just don't understand why they'd restructure like that when Blizzard has been turning record breaking profits. Wasn't Mike Morhaime doing perfectly fine? I'm sure after starting Blizzard he is quite able to report directly to Overlord Bobby Koitcock rather than have a middle man in between them with senseless bureaucracy. If I was Morhaime I'd be really pissed right now. Then again Morhaime is filthy rich.

With guys, there's a fair amount of agreement on what's attractive, but with girls you can easily have a third say a guy is the hottest guy who ever lived, a third say he's alright, and the other third say that the guy isn't ugly but really isn't attractive.

Worst thing a guy can do is smell funny. Second-worst is to look unwashed. You don't want a girl shaking your hand and wondering where it's been lately, or noticing stains on or holes in your shirt.

I broke through at 46mg, but I felt like I wasn't quite there.  I think 50mg to 60mg is ""my"" dose for a good trip.

It was really really strange though.  More than just my mind separating from my body.

My mind was separating from ITSELF.  I felt like my consciousness was divided up into like 5 sections, and each section did their own thing.

One of the sections had fear in it, but the part that I was experiencing didn't sense the fear, so it was fine.  That part was trying to watch my breathing in my body, but was barely able to do it.

Now before you say anything about social constructs being the determinant of gender or other such nonsense, I am familiar with the studies concerning BSTc differences in male-to-female transsexuals. This points to nothing more than one possible neurophysiological basis for gender identity disorder. It does nothing to explain the many other sexually dimorphic areas of the brain, and certainly doesn't suggest that you can just assign yourself to the female population when comparing differences in intelligence.

The glass cover would be handy in protecting accidental triggering. 

As for the HUD, I totally agree. As soon as the glass cover is flipped, blammo, just like in the new Caddy's or Benz's a projector on the opposite side of the rearview mirror gives you a display of CO2 remaining, ammo remaining, and a moving crosshairs correlated to the joystick and position of the gun behind the emblem.

If we want to get REALLY crazy, we could opt for a feed from the onboard computer, taking into account vehicle speed (and thus real and apparent wind conditions), GPS coordinates, and exterior temperature that would all affect the adjustment of the barrel so you would always hit your target.

The next step after that must be using the laser-rangefinder from automatic cruise controls (aligned with the HUD crosshair display, of course) to calibrate the distance to the object you currently have the HUD cross-hairs fixed on. The distance could also be projected onto the HUD.","1270085613"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","&gt; classical music gets a lot more technical than metal  
  
Are you saying that to be condescending or do you know nothing about metal?  There are metal musicians who *literally* play lines from classical pieces in their songs.  Necrophagist [does this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DND8S_CF_g).  The end solo is a Prokofiev piece (and, I might add, is notably less technical than the rest of the song).  Alexi Laiho released a series of instructional videos on playing Vivaldi's Four Seasons metal style.  Metal can be as technical or simplistic as you want to make it, *just like classical music*.  
  
&gt; it's not really the technicality that's the major draw, it's the timbre;  
  
Again with the condescension.  Then why don't (the vast majority of) Necrophagist fans also listen to Korn?  Same timbre.  And why don't classical fans all flock to [Apocalyptica](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dwgqxc7Ynpk)?  It's  played on acoustic cellos.  
  
Based on your argument the same could be said about classical/jazz.  Many people listen to classical/jazz because it's ""pretty"" and ""soothing"" and don't know shit about music theory.  Should I say that therefore the major draw must be the ""timbre""?  If you want to lump in non-technical metal fans, then you have to lump in non-technical classical fans too.  
  
I like metal for its ""timbre"" *as much as I like it for its technicality*.  I also listen to both classical/jazz for the *exact same reasons*.  I like both their timbre and technicality.   Why do you insist that classical/jazz is the bastion of technicality and that their fans are somehow more appreciative of technical prowess?  Certain forms of classical fetishize technicality just like certain forms of metal and certain forms of jazz.  And for every Slayer there are Pachelbel's Canons and Kenny G's.  
  
Perhaps the technical fans of metal don't all indulge in classical because most classical music was written hundreds of years ago and does not reflect current cultural themes and fans of classical music like to cultivate a condescending attitude towards outsiders by playing their music in giant concert halls and charging $200 per ticket and wearing tuxedos to the show.  Perhaps classical music fans don't like to hang around in bars full of pot smoke and 25-year olds.  
  
&gt; stop getting all butt-hurt... cut back on personal insults  
  
I can play your game too:  *Did my ""personal insults"" hurt your feelings?  I'm sorry I called you ""Emperor of Music"".  Don't get all butt-hurt about me being butt-hurt.*

"gaming","t5_2qh03","The review was spot on. I spent $14 and 19 hours playing a rental for the PS3 and I'm glad I didn't shell out $60 plus 10% sales tax on the game.

It's an RPG stripped down to emulate a beat'em up game. To save what little RPG and strategy credibility the game (and series) has left, they add the paradigm shift gimmick. Which just allows you to press TWO buttons to button mash as frantically as you can instead of one. The game is an exercise in finger dexterity. There isn't anything deep or challenging about it. Thus the mass market appeal criteria is met and the shareholders are happy.

I agree with everyone else that the graphics are beautiful. The sound track is amazing as well...on it's own. Married with the game it has issues. Some tracks just don't fit the scene they are supporting AT ALL. It's quite jarring. Also the victory tune right after the battle abruptly cuts out for no reason before the after battle status screen, which makes the game feel less than polished. I can't think of any other game that has sound editing issues like this.

Despite all the gripes, I didn't mind Vanille. She's like a fly trapped in the house banging against a window to get out. If you focus on how annoying it is, you'll get annoyed, if you ignore it, hopefully the fly (and Vanille) will die and go away. 

Hope was pathetic and I got tired of listening to him whine for 19 hours. Him alone easily makes Final Fantasy XIII coaster worthy. His character is completely unbelievable. There are invertebrates with larger backbones than this kid has.

Ultimately, there is a reason why this game didn't sell very well in Japan and is now in bargain bins at local shops. Yahtzee's review hit most of the points right on the head. Despite how fervently nationalistic and supporting of all things Final Fantasy, the Japanese know a stinker when they see one.","1270085711"

So why use a translation that uses those terms? NIV or tNIV or NASB are good translations that are written in modern prose and will avoid you making basic mistakes as in your first quote:

&gt;Matthew 19:23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

In this verse in Matthew the word ""*dyskolōs*"" meaning ""with difficulty"" is rendered in 17th Century English as ""hardly"". Reading that as a modern day English user it appears to imply a rich man can't get to heaven but that's a fault of relying on an inappropriate translation.

As for the Lazarus story (OT: I think the only named lead character in a parable) it seems quite clear to me that it is about the rich man failing to even consider the poor guy and provide any evidence of *agape* (charitable love) and not his wealth *per se* that witnesses against him.

To my mind it is harder for a rich person, they have the lure of luxurious living and often appear to lust for money over all other things - such things appear to get in the way of noble pursuits.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm talking about the MMR poll. Unknown pollsters who also had some laughable poll this month with Sarah Palin losing to Romney and IIRC Huckabee, and Ron Paul at 12% in a current GOP presidential poll. They say they use a different and confidential method or something. There is a local guy named Jim Phillips who is about as liberal as they come (reality, liberal bias, etc). He's a straight shooter though for the most part and went off about these pollsters one day and was laughing at the balls on Grayson for this stunt.

[From HuffPo](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/04/grayson-leading-in-republ\_n\_486090.html):

&gt; The candidate leading the Florida GOP primary to determine who will take on Rep. Alan Grayson, the Democrat who represents the Orlando-based district, is none other than Grayson himself, according to a poll paid for by his campaign. 

So he paid for it. It's just the vaibility of the result that's up for grabs. The pollsters aren't well known, won't release the wording or the methods ... and I mean, come on - you'd have to live in the woods between Orlando and Daytona to get this I suppose, really get it ... but that's so laughable it isn't funny.

Like I said, I think he's arguably one of the more useful politicians, especially in driving discourse in controversial directions and we really need that ... but a guy who *infamous* around here for some of the things he's said about what amounts to entire towns in his district? ... releasing that result is a calculated political move IMHO. For the life of me, I just can't figure the upside. I suppose it may be a good thing to have HuffPo all fired up, and alienate vast swaths of your voting public. It seems odd to me is all. Maybe it's to gather up out of state donations come election time. That could work I suppose, if they throw enough money at smoothing things over.

On Children
 Kahlil Gibran

""Your children are not your children.
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.
They come through you but not from you,
And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

You may give them your love but not your thoughts, 
For they have their own thoughts.
You may house their bodies but not their souls,
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, 
which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
You may strive to be like them, 
but seek not to make them like you.
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.

You are the bows from which your children
as living arrows are sent forth.
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, 
and He bends you with His might 
that His arrows may go swift and far.
Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;
For even as He loves the arrow that flies, 
so He loves also the bow that is stable.""","1270085903"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","How is it grosses than your cervix and vaginal walls disengaging and cleansing itself of foreign bodies and keeping bacteria balanced or your plasma (a component of your blood) secreting itself through your vaginal walls that happens the other days you're not on your period?  
The former refers to vaginal secretions/discharge that all women have to varying degrees on a daily basis and the latter refers to women's lubricant that occurs when she is turned on.  Why is the smell of blood grosser than your normal smell?  Why can't it just be viewed as different smell?   Couldn't the emotional/psychological symbolism of blood as a life force coming out during a woman's period and even being covered in it be seen as a powerful and deeply connecting event or symbol rather than a scary or gross one?  

Why is blood gross? Grosser than other bodily fluids?  Why in particular is menstrual blood so much grosser that it makes sex or physical intimacy undesirable?  Absolutely not meaning to be confrontational, I'm honestly posing questions that I'm seeking your view/opinion/thoughts on, by the way.  Have you ever thought about and come up with your own reasons for why you see this as grosser than the other things I mentioned?  Is it possible that you've internalized long standing cultural standards (in most societies/cultures) that declared women's menses as scary, bad, dirty, and even evil?  Even though societally we may not feel as fearful/disgusted by women, their bodies, and its functions a lot of those residual feelings and thoughts have trickled down in an emotional sense.  

If there was some kind of evidence you could point to or show me that would show how menstrual blood is significantly dirtier (in a pathogen sense, not a cultural/emotional one) or negatively different from usual vaginal or, for that matter, penile, secretions (in terms of its material makeup and how it negatively affects or harms a person coming in contact with it in a physical or chemical sense) then I'd be happy to accept that one might view period blood as 'gross.'  Without that evidence though, I have to think this view is evidence of an inherited bias against women and their bodies that should hopefully have no place and be minimized, if not completely abandoned, as we work towards a more equitable society.

Again, I re-iterate that I am in no way meaning to be confrontational about this, just posing the questions and looking for answers.

Time isn't really going to degrade the sound, it might make the record brittle but only playback degrades it from what i know. Something like Dust-Off Or Endust might work if they don't leave residues.  The program you are using to record it might dictate what bitrate you are using. A sample rate of 96k is optimal, with a 24-bit bit depth you are not going to have to worry about getting it loud enough generally. Otherwise at 16 bit, you are going to want to make sure the signal is hot enough going into your computer without ever clipping (going red).

You do realize that you are stating this in a thread about the Koch family spending $25 million dollars to obfuscate the entire climate debate, right?  Most actual climatologists that come out against climate change do have serious financial conflict of interests.  You are unwilling to see this and in fact seem unwilling to have an actual discussion.  The only fact I have put forward so far has been the temperature increase over the past century and a half.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The day officially changed because the Romans (Constantine I, 321 AD) declared Sunday to be the day of rest.  Mostly due to 'pagan' influence regarding Sol Invictus (the Sun God).  Before this time, I don't *think* either day was strongly preferred, and some early Christians (former Jews) worshiped both days.

So basically, it was about culturally assimilating with the pagans and distancing themselves from the Jews (whom, even then, were hated).

&gt;The dominant religions in the regions of the world where Christianity was developing were pagan, and in Rome, Mithraism, specifically the cult of Sol Invictus, had taken hold. Mithraism met on Sunday. Some theorize that, because the practice favored the Christian day by coincidence, it also helped the church to avoid implicit association with the Jews. Jews were being persecuted routinely at this time, because of the Jewish-Roman Wars, and for this reason Constantine's edict, and Christian reception of it, is sometimes labelled anti-semitic.

Quote from the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath_in_Christianity#Edict_of_Constantine).  Other sources were also consulted, but they're highly suspect.  I only used the little pieces that they agreed on.  I don't stand by this as being totally correct, but this is the picture I was able to put together before I lost interest.

Edit: grammar, etc.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","First off, I should point out that your attempt to upset me, or whatever it is you intended, with your condescending, haughty, and confident style of communication was made completely in vain.  I'm not the least bit intimidated, offended, or impressed by your use of sarcasm.  (E.G.  ""love, cunty muccunterson"")

&gt;...called me a cunt...  
&gt;cunty mccunterson  

I hoped that you would fall into my trap by taking issue with my use of the word 'cunt'.  Apparently, the use of the pejorative epithet 'homo' doesn't denote homophobia and one is, therefore, not justified in making any accusations of impropriety against its users, but the use of the word 'cunt' does denote sexism on the part of those who utter it, in your mind, and *does*, then, justify becoming angry over its use.  Is that your attitude?  Am I far off?

&gt;anyhow, i'm not on any horse and don't take anything redditers say to heart so nothing you say is ""personal"" to me.

Clearly, that's not the case; otherwise you wouldn't have responded to me at any point, nor especially would you have, in the course of responding to me, resorted to the use of aspersions and caps lock, which, as I know you're aware, symbolizes yelling according to internet customs.  As for your claim of not being on a high horse... well, let's say, you sure did have a didactic, supercilious tone in your last post for someone who wasn't on a high horse. 

&gt;clearly, with an attitude like yours you wouldn't last too long down there or wouldn't have too many friends. most likely, you would spend your nights lonely, whacking off and crying in your corner of a desolate bone zone.

This is just a hypocritical and childish slinging of insults that are perfectly innocuous on account of how baseless they are.  (It's hypocritical because you criticized me for presuming to know anything about your boyfriend and his mindset, but you didn't hesitate in the least to assume you had a thorough understanding of my nature, which is evinced both in your assertion that I would end up friendless, crying myself to sleep rather than partaking of any of the fun of the bone zone and in your assertion in your last post that I was taking things personally; not calm; and accused your boyfriend of being a homophobe.)

&gt;also, may i point out to you that the ""homophobic boyfriend"" answered several questions about the gay population in antarctica and was knowledgeable enough to satisfy other commenters and even defended the lgbt population as well.

What's you're point?  I never called him homophobic.  You read that into my post.  As I've had to say to a number of other Redditors already, sometimes it's best not to attempt to read in between the lines.

There's a distinct difference between hating/fearing gays (homophobia) and hating/fearing being thought of as gay because you knew how gays are treated in the mean.  I'm not in the habit of ascribing hatred for my kind to those who would prefer not to be seen as gay; that would be a hasty, fallacious conclusion.  I only meant to indict your boyfriend of this preference, no more and no less.

(One exception to this is Colorado, where children not properly restrained is a primary offense and brings a much larger fine.) If a driver commits a primary violation (e.g., for speeding) he may additionally be charged for not wearing a seatbelt.

"math","t5_2qh0n","Most PhD programs will cover your tuition and pay a stipend (which is typically from $14-22k per academic year, depending on where you are). You'll also get health insurance, so it's livable, and I would strongly suggest against going to a PhD program in pure mathematics that isn't offering you something like that. This is of course in exchange for you teaching, grading, tutoring, etc on a part time basis (which would come out to ~14-20 hrs per week).

As far as which schools you should apply to, that's definitely something you should talk to professors about. If they know you, you can ask them for what sort of schools they think would be a ""good fit"" for you, which is really just code for you asking them to rank you against the other students. Typically someone coming out of a BS won't have a clear idea of what they want (even if they think they do), and their interests also have a good chance of changing when they begin doing serious graduate work, so the general advice is to just go to the best school that you can get into. Of course you know best how you feel about various subjects. If you have taken several legit classes in analysis, algebra, and topology (even better if they are grad classes) and feel that analysis is the best fit for you, it's certainly worthwhile to focus on schools that are strong in analysis but perhaps weak elsewhere.

I will also give some unsolicited advice about applying. Letters of recommendation were a huge factor in grad school's reaction to my application. My undergrad gpa was 2.7 (although I had A's in classes like real analysis, algebra, topology, probability, I also got a C in complex analysis and a D in undergrad PDE, as well as awful grades outside of math, basically due to laziness). In the fall I will be going to a decent grad school (top 40 but not top 20) on a VIGRE fellowship, and because my grades were so bad the offer I got had to have been based extremely heavily on my rec letters. So, get to know your professors, and find ones who will be able to say something interesting about you. It will definitely pay off. ","1270086096"

Go to counseling.  Do not be afraid.  If it is the end, you are getting the (hopefully) key help on learning from your experience.  If it is not the end, you will have pulled in help when it was needed.  Just like going to the doctor.

That being said; virtual qwerty is in no wise a satisfactory substitute for a qwerty equivalent to that of the G1's.  It is simply physically incapable of performing the same tasks and is an inferior solution in terms of standard usage in comparison as well.  I *have* used both, and that is my conclusion.  99.99999% of the time, I use the hard-qwerty.  That will remain the case.  Especially since there are, again, things I do that ***require*** a physical keyboard.  Such as VNC usage and recovery console usage.  Neither of which can be done on a hard-key-less machine.

Their ""Zionist enemy"" will gladly give them land  to build their own state and Israel has zero desire to kill or harm them.  Palestinaians are the most emotinoally and financially supported people on earth - who could have a peaceful,  prosperous state tomorrow if they would renounce violence &amp; jihad - and decided that improving their own lives was of greater priority than trying to make Israeli's lives eternally miserable.

I have sympathy for the average kid in the street because their ""leaders"" -- Hitler's collaborator Huseyni, terrorist Arafat, Holocaust denier Abbas, Iran-backed Hamas  --  have brainwashed them into counter-productive, unprogressive ways of thinking...and glorified a culture of ""resistance"" - a.k.a. . .resistance to peace, resistance to self-responsibility, [resistance to anyone telling the truth or discussing things freely](http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=172106)... ""resistance"" to all that is potentially positive or constructive.

They feel ""shame"" because leaving behind the comfort and security blanket of being able to blame their neighbors for EVERYTHING is too scary for them to face.  It means they'd have to be responsible and be constructive. It's easy to stay in misery and on welfare - because at least its predictable... and it's easy... and billions of miserable, helpless people around (socialists, Muslims, antisemites)  the world blindly support the Palestinians in their machoistic struggle against freedom and sanity.

Palestinians leaders never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity... because they are extremely comfortable with the status quo... and are terrified to think of themselves as anything other than subjects and victims.

They have been occupied for the past 600 years or more... most recently by Hamas and the PLO...  and aren't ready to face a live of independence and responsibility... not ready to make the messy compromises demanded by civilization... which means shifting away from toxic blame and being brave enough to build a better future.

I hope they find the courage to swallow their pride and accept reality - imperfect or shameful as it may be - and make a radical change for a better life!

Yes, but neither is A. Now, any point you choose won't be a neighboring point since your construction is valid for any point. (There's an infinity of points between any 2 points.

Yes, that's it. For every point you choose, there's one that's closer.

&gt;So... One of A,B,C is NOT a neighbor of X, for ANY 3 numbers you choose...
&gt;Therefore there cannot be more than 2 neighbors for X.

What you said is true! You have proven that there can't be more than 2! But the truth is that there's actually none, and if you apply that construction from my last post, you will see that none of them actually is, since there's going to be more points even closer to X that you didn't consider.

I'm assuming you mean genital herpes, for oral herpes is prevelant in 50% of people, and shows marked, occasional sores, but is far more manageable in terms of lifestyle status.

If you're talking genital herpes, 1 in 6 people have it, so the prevalence rate is actually higher than most people think. A lot of individuals have it, and it is quite manageable. You'll be dormant most of the time, that is lacking sores, with occasional outbreaks. 

If you are male, then most likely your partner most likely has it. If you're female, there is less of a chance that you have passed it to him, but still likely if you engage in frequent sex.

I hate them, because usually there's a few songs on there I love in the context of the album they're on and when they finish I'm expecting the next track from the album.","1270086366"

But now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever read a book or seen a movie where the good guy was a rapist.  Because normal, healthy people would find that absolutely repulsive.

But you're defending a game that invites you to fantasize that you're a rapist.  Yes, they're just polygons, and words are just ink on a page, so what?  It's what those things mean to you and how they make you feel.  And apparently the polygons in this game make you feel entertained by pretending you're raping women.

Why am I even trying to have a discourse with you?  You're fucked in the head.  You're a piece of shit who couldn't even begin to understand anything I'm saying.  Jesus, I feel sorry for any woman who makes the mistake of letting you close.

I wouldn't enjoy ""murdering people without prejudice,"" or fantasizing about it.  If you're referring to my comment about shooting you in the back of the head, I say that with extreme prejudice.

    Control-A, Control-X

*Increment/Decrement number beneath cursor*

    :set ft=&lt;filetype&gt;

*useful when , eg, you're working on some javascript in an html file, and you want % to work for toggling between braces; you would use :set ft=javascript in this case.*

    :set virtualedit=all

*Allows your cursor to roam anywhere in the file, even areas that are not populated by text. This is purely a matter of preference, I think.*

    set viminfo='25,&lt;10000,n~/.viminfo directory=~/.vim/swp

*This saves the contents of your registers, and saves marks you added in a file you were editing, and folds.*

    :set wcm=&lt;Tab&gt; wildmenu wildmode=list:full

*A nifty autocompletion function for the vim command-line. Very useful for searching the vim help system.*

*makes backspace work more the way you are accustomed - delete newlines, etc.*

Useful Plugins in my .vim:

surround.vim - makes it possible to very quickly add html tags, parens, brackets, braces, or arbitrary characters around text objects.

NERDTree - a file manager in vim. m allows you to rename/delete files.

visincr - quickly increment/decrement a column of numbers or dates

align - quickly align text on, for example, equals signs

I'm active in the area campaign for liberty so I have some insight over the past few years in politics and a couple election cycles... but I wouldn't canvass for Grayson. Keller, was of course, an asshole. I agree with you, and think the same goes for Kosmas winning over that Feeney crook. 

That said, I don't have the intense dislike for him that I do for most politicians. I won't work for him, and probably wouldn't vote for him even, but I don't mind tossing out that the reality on the ground is that he'll probably need a lot of help in the way of campaigners and out of area support. I certainly wouldn't be upset if he eat the GOP in a Grayson-GOP pigeon general election. 

I'm seeing a lot of numbers on our end that look to be showing a real lack of voter support for not only Grayson's interviews where he touted grabbing the pork, but the voters themselves probably won't return, especially with the ""evil"" Feeney and Keller gone already. I'm not excited to say this (I like Ron Paul, libertarians, etc. Sarah Palin and her ilk are a common enemy, promise) ... but I think the reality is the public is swaying hugely in a pro-tea-party, protofascist direction.

Nope. This is intentionally done by the reddit dev team. If they allowed people to block certain submitters, spammers would just get blocked and not reported / removed. Then the every day average person who visits the front page (without logging in) will see nothing but spam, and think to themselves, ""An entire news aggregation site with nothing but spam?

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;Let’s get this straight: any woman who heads to an EI party as an anonymous onlooker, drinks five cups of the jungle juice, and walks back to a boy’s room with him is indicating that she wants sex, OK? To cry “date rape” after you sober up the next morning and regret the incident is the equivalent of pulling a gun to someone’s head and then later claiming that you didn’t ever actually intend to pull the trigger.

You do not have the right to incapacitate yourself, abandon your nonsensical body in a dangerous place, and expect Knights in Shining Armour to guard your stupid, drunk ass.

No one has the right to have sex with an incapacitated person (barring some prestanding explicit agreement, and even that's highly controversial and outside of the scope of my argument).  But you never leave valuable property (and your own body is the most valuable property you have) unguarded.

complicating the situation is the fact that there's a huge grey area between ""one sip of beer isn't going to hurt me."" and  ""drunk enough to pass out / throw up.""   You probably  don't have the training to find the magic black line in all that grey. 

Is Hot Hanna with Amoretto on her lips really into me, or is she drunk as shit?  Is her voice slurred like that because of boose, or does she really have a mild speech impediment?    It's not like she's falling down, and she is laughing at my jokes.  It's an annoying laugh, but she's got a great face and nice tits.  And she's either got a nervous tick, or she's winked at me twice.

Should I make her sing the 'Magdelina Hagdeline Hoofeneiner Waffleirner' song before we make out?  If she does it well, is it only because she's too drunk to realise how stupid the song is?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The best way to start a conversation with pretty much anybody is to ask them something about them self. People (most of them, anyway) find nothing more interesting to talk about than themselves.

Whatever interests you about them, ask them about. Cool tattoo - I like that tat, who inked you? Cool jacket - I like that jacket, where did you get that? Who makes it? Think they are smart in a class you have with them? Ask them what they think about some current topics from the class.

Doesn't matter. As long as you don't come off as prying about something too personal, or the other person is an introvert as well, you will have a conversation rolling in no time.

They scare me but here's the thing that keeps me wanting to engage them: I'm no smarter than they are. I've fallen for the same lies, believed the same propaganda, felt the same anger.

I want to do the same for them.","1270086604"
"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Hey, just created my account tonight after having discovered your post for the new teaching gig.

I'm a (fairly) recent college grad with a degree in Psych, but through a series of interesting coincidences, ended up teaching Math 101 at a local University part-time.  Literally, I was thrown in with no supervision and even less instruction - my supervisor didn't even know my name or what I looked like until the end of Final's Week (I had passed her in the hallway several times, but she never recognized).  This is what I learned through trial and error (mostly error, please learn from my mistakes):

1.  They are more afraid of you than you are of them - you hold all of the cards, you guard all of the gates, you decide who passes and who fails.  Confidence is the key.  Get into a mindset where you realize your task is to simply instill what knowledge you contain, and that you know you will be able to provide that knowledge to these kids, who will then take it and do with it what they will.

2.  Be *mostly* honest, but not *completely* honest.  Remember your parents/mentors saying that it's always best to be honest?  That does not apply in certain situations.  Specifically, you do not want to tell this class that it is the first course you've ever taught.  Sure, you may play the scenario out in your head and it may come across as cheeky, clever, or at the very least entertaining, but to these kids, it will sound like you're an incompetent who just happened to walk into a classroom.  Trust me, everyone will play their part, the students will act like students (some of them will be asshats) and the teacher will act like a teacher.  You are the educator, if you act like one, they will respect you like one (and you will be very surprised at how your behavior will change when you make this transition).  I recommend wearing sweater vests, as they are disarmingly calming (boring) and professional (old-personey).

3.  Be yourself, be friendly.  If you are a huge nerd, be a huge nerd!  These kids will probably call you on it if you act like something you're not.  Hell, if you're teaching Physics, you were probably hired because you came off as intelligent, dorky and excited about the subject matter.  Let that shine through.  But seriously, avoid math/physics-based jokes, as most will not laugh and those that do will probably be shoved into a locker for laughing.

4.  Be consistent, be competent.  Show no favoritism, you are not there to make friends.  Plus, if you happen to get a student who feels that you did show favoritism, it may cause quite a few administrative headaches.  You do NOT want this to happen.  Get in there and teach your ass off, to the benefit of everyone.

5.  Their success is not your priority, but teaching them is.  Do the best you can with what you've got.  People WILL fail.  More people will pass.  It may be different in a High School setting, but the point is that you cannot be held responsible for every single student's success, up to a point.  Students will choose not to come to class, to do the homework, or to generally give a shit.  Teach to the best of your ability - everything else should fall into place.

6.  You will make mistakes, do not try to hide them.  I cannot express how often you will make mistakes and errors on the board while teaching these students.  Don't worry about it.  If you make a mistake or if something doesn't calculate out correctly, take a step back, take a deep breath (do not get too embarrassed, remember, this even happened to your Professors), and check out the problem to see where you went wrong.  If you're lucky, you'll have an entire class of eager, young minds who have been following along and would be excited to figure out why that particular problem didn't work like it should have.

And that's all I've got.  I'm done.  Oh, nope, I've got a little more:

Addendum:  Numbers 1 and 2 will get you started, the others are just helpful hints that you'll figure out throughout the semester/year.
Addendum 2:  Message me if you have any questions or concerns, I'd be more than happy to help out.

...Now I'm done.

Two of them left, and then about five minutes later the last guy got up, walked over to me and said, ""I just thought you should know you're really beautiful."", and I was pretty shocked. I don't get compliments like that- much less in a swimsuit.

 I turned red, said thank you, and he walked away to the changing rooms. I didn't see him again. I'm sure he was just some nice guy letting me know I shouldn't be so self conscious, and I'm sure a lot of women would have been creeped out, but I can really appreciate a person with the kind of balls to cheer up a stranger in a way that puts them out there so much.

Make sure that any partner you're considering spending the rest of your lives together (presumably) shares you views on sex.  Sex is important to you and it's important to you that you have an open minded partner as well, so screw any tradition and ask potential future partners about (but maybe not during a combined family dinner).  Talk to your future partners about their views on sex and exploration and how they view their and your body.  Even in actually engaging in pre-marital sex is not something you or your potential partner want to engage in, you can still talk about it.

And on a side note, if you expect your partner to be open about sexual things, I hope you plan on being similarly open in regards to her body and potential desires and needs.  Good luck!","1270086667"

Presumable he just wanted some money in it, but when he discovered that there were car keys in that wallet, his plan had started at that point.  Since he didn't have the alarm disarmer, he couldn't actually steal my car without the alarm going off with just the backup key. 

senior year: He made up some excuse to invite himself to my house for the first time since sophomore year - it was around April that year.  He took my car keys, including the alarm disarmer.  They've been missing at my parents' house since, though a lot of my former friends just believe the keys are just lost somewhere.

Since I didn't have any keys to drive my car to school anymore, I was dropped off at school.  He realized he couldn't steal my car if it was in my parents' house garage, so he showed up a couple days later with the pretense that he wanted to show me a sound system in his car, and happened to find my backup keys that were missing since sophomore year, with some kind of reasoning that he found it in the gutter.  Those keys were immaculate, definitely not worn down by the elements.

I pretty much suspected what was going on at this point, but it sounds really outrageous doesn't it?  I went ahead and drove to school with the backup keys, unable to arm the alarm.

Players have to compete over destroying enemy waves, and because they don't have the capacity to deny the other team, they're forced to actively seek out exp. to stay competitive. Also, in the long run it punishes players who don't farm well and neglect turrets since the other team collects large sums of gold from destroying waves of mins and killing turrets.

You are at a rough patch. One year olds are exhausting. They are into everything but not old enough yet to be easily disciplined and you still have to do everything for them. They are the most work ever at this age.

In a few months your kid will have learned a few more rules and boundaries and life will start improving. You are about to turn the corner from having a baby to having a kid that can feed himself and go to the bathroom himself and pick up his own toys and put them away. 
 
Here's a few tips to get you over the hump and on your way to having your life back.

* Set a strict and early bedtime for your kid so you and your wife can have some quality time.

* Encourage your kid to be independent. It won't hurt the kid to learn to play with toys by himself or do things for himself.

* Have more sex. Even if you have to schedule it, even if its going to be quickie during nap time or lazy sex before bed it is still better than no sex. You and your wife will get along better and feel better about your relationship if you both try to make sex a priority again.

*  Kids are portable. Seriously. If you work at training your kid and enforcing rules, you can have a child that is perfectly pleasant to take to restaurants, on shopping trips and over to friend's houses to visit. Go have fun *with* the kid.  

*  Go have some grown up time. Even if you can't afford a babysitter, you and your wife can take turns having a night out while the other stays home with the baby. Go out and get really drunk with your friends, tell your wife to do the same. You'll both feel better once the hangover wears off.","1270086724"
"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","This is a good setup and will most definitely get you going. Excellent choice on the SM58. This microphone will teach you the basics of how to record your voice, and you won't be likely to either break it or get rid of it. Also, if you can't get a decent, usable recording with an SM58, you're doing something wrong. Which brings me to this:

**DON'T CUP THE MIC.**

Cupping the mic is a guaranteed method of achieving the shittiest sound possible with the 58. Instead, learn mic discipline and placement/proximity as you MC with it. This will take a little bit of practice, but will result in your verses coming out clear, powerful and intelligible, which is what you what.  

Don't bother with condensers at this point, because they will introduce a whole new range of issues to deal with and you've got plenty to learn about already.

And don't let anyone diss your SM58, or tell you that 'it's only for live sound.' That's a pro mic through and through, despite the low price. I've never been in a professional recording studio that didn't have at least a few of them kicking around. ","1270086726"

I think you're confusing two ideas here. If your university is anything like the ones I know, there's a large parking shortage. A market system could take care of that, but it would be unpalatable. So, they must look for other methods of solving the problem. One could be subsidizing public transportation. There's no marginal cost with each ride, so I am pretty sure usage would go up, and that would help with the parking situation.

I'm not really sure what you're getting at, because I'm not sure what you're calling socialized, what you're calling bad, and what you're calling good.

No matter how you justify it, the reason you've created this structure will in the end be because you have different emotional responses to the two situations.

For abortion specifically, the question becomes when do you *feel* that it is no longer okay to kill an unborn baby?

My question is: Who wants to get an abortion for malicious reasons? Who gets an abortion precisely because they want to do harm to an unborn fetus?

Like I said, even if it happens rarely, the results can still be catastrophic. I'm not sure if the irony in the statement was missed or not, but it's nigh impossible to have accurate data on how often corporations hide data.

Furthermore, you don't actually have to compare it to every time it doesn't happen because my argument is that self-regulation does not work. That is, a free market *will* result in an inefficient distribution of resources. My argument is not that it happens more often than it does not.

&gt;Well, why aren't your beloved government regulators protecting us from these popular Monsanto products?

Because they're on the payroll, of course. I also think it's laughable that you assume I love government because I think that corporate self-regulation wouldn't work.

&gt;I hope you're not going to tell me there isn't enough regulation. If so, I suggest you go try and start a new chemical company anywhere in the U.S. You'll need an army of lawyers to deal with the regulations.

I disagree with the way you phrase it. You can have billions of regulations on things that are designed to prevent new companies from entering the market, and still not have protections for people and consumers in place. Adding protections for the public is ""more"" regulations. ""More"" is not good or bad, it depends on the specific regulations in place. 

Obviously, I'm not suggesting that we keep companies from starting up to prevent currently established companies from harming people. That's counter-intuitive. I'm suggesting that we fix what's wrong with the system: We lack regulations where we need them, we have them where they shouldn't be, and we have an incestuous relationship between government and business.","1270086781"

No, you don't. You don't realize it yet, but you don't. You don't dispute the fact that you think men are puppets. It's one or the other--free will or pawns. They are mutually exclusive, and therefore cannot exist at the same time in any rational reality. God, being rational in nature (as we can determine from the rational universe), cannot contain within himself such a self-contradiction.

&gt; Its the acceptance that finite beings cannot exhaustively understand an infinite God.

There's a large difference between acceptance of a reality beyond comprehension (as this does not preclude the attempt to comprehend, in the likelihood that the concept is not really beyond human understanding), and blind adherence to something that doesn't make sense in any way of thinking.

&gt; What about the crucifixion of Jesus? Was that an evil scheme?

Insofar as it was an act of self-mutilation, yes. Insofar as God orchestrated the entrance of evil into the universe (which was a consequence of the free will that is inherent in human nature in my scheme of thinking), and demanded a blood sacrifice for it, and then carried out his own execution, then yes. If God is sovereign over every act of man then there was no reason for a sacrifice, as everything went according to script.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I'm not sure what you are trying to achieve. The points that you raise give no further evidence of him writing it. You may not be aware but there were various writings produced in Peters name, funnily enough he was a rather popular person to forge and no wonder why.

Also I want to bring some things that I let go by, somewhat expecting you to at least recognise my points.

&gt;It was considered cannon also by many of the early Christians, specifically Irenaeus, Cyril, and Origen, Eusebius, and Athanasius, all of which pre-dated the council of Carthage.

Origen:

In Expositions on the Gospel according to John which we have recorded through quotation by Eusebius 
""And Peter, on whom the church of Christ is built, against which the gates of Hades shall not prevail, has left one acknowledged epistle, and, it may be, a second also, for it is doubted."" (H.E. 6.25.8)

Eusebius:

It is clear that Eusebius did not consider 2 Peter as canonical, 
""Of the disputed books which are nevertheless known to most are the letter called James, that of Jude, the second letter of Peter, and the so-called second and third letters of John"" (H.E. 3.25.3)

""But the so-called second letter [of Peter] we have not received as canonical, but nevertheless it has appeared useful to many, and has been studied with other scriptures"" (H.E. 3.3.1)

Irenaeus:
As far as I have read Irenaeus never stated 2 Peter as canonical, it is asserted that he references it but this is debated.

Either you have different sources than me or you are being intentionally dishonest. But as I said before for me I believe our modern methods of determining authorship are superior to those of the time. Keep in mind that most references to 2 Peter were only allusions which are unclear.

&gt;1 Peter ends with the acknowledgement that a brother and scribe named Silvanus was used by Peter to write the letter.

1 Peter 5:12
This interpretation is not clear, he does not directly say that Silvanus is writing for him, you may interpret it that way but others don't.

Bear in mind that the claim is not that someone heretical wrote 2 Peter it is that one of peters disciples wrote it, which also accounts for the knowledge of 1 Peter.

&gt;Either these letters are written by the Apostle Peter, or you have a case where a deeply religious and spiritual person is lying through his teeth pretending to be someone he is not, because either way, the author of these letters is clearly a very religious person.

It was quite common to find pseudonymous letters in the era and we have many cases of this.

&gt;There is something to be said though for being so much closer time-wise to when these things were written. 

This is not true from what I have seen, and if you know other areas of history you may see that too.

&gt;indisputable proof that Peter could not have written his letters.

This type of argument you clearly don't apply to all fields otherwise I would be right to assume you believe in some of the numerous other gods or prophets who as you know we don't have indisputable proof of their non-existence or for their lying.

&gt;1 was probably written before Jerusalem was destroyed, but 2 was likely written during the period when Nero was torturing and killing Christians for sport. (2 Peter 4:12-14)

I don't know how to find that verse are you sure you didn't mean 1 Peter 4:12-14?

What do you think was relative percentage of Jews to Christians during the Siege of Jerusalem?

&gt;No I am sure the writer would not have embellished what Peter wrote, if Peter had said ""good"" the translator would NOT have wrote ""super awesome good"" instead.

You are being facetious, you know what is nothing like what we are talking about.

&gt;So, given these facts, if the clever and educated writer of 2 Peter had wanted to make clever forgery you would think that they would be able to do so simply by looking at 1 Peter and copying the style.

I think the many examples of forgery uncovered render this argument void.","1270086800"

Despite being very attractive, she was really self-conscious (I think about her age, since I'm only 24), and I had to tell her to stay and talk multiple times. We talked the rest of the night, and exchanged numbers. I moved shortly thereafter, but I would have dated her if I hadn't.

Worst- Lots of times girls will come up and introduce themselves, only to say ""you should go talk to my friend."" And usually it's the hot, confident, outgoing one who initiates contact, only to have me disappointed when I meet her friend. If you're into a guy, just chat him up directly.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Well, I can't speak for other opinions but I generally like Google.

What tank man did was purely altruistic and that just cannot be the case with a huge corporation like Google. Maybe they could be so on some smaller scale but not on something as huge as China. That line you ask about is not some concrete number or defined mark... it depends on Google's business goals, their future gameplan and how much they stand to gain/lose (economically, publicity-wise, future potential-wise) by such a move.

They are a business making a business decision (that also happens to dovetail nicely with popular sentiment against China in the West) and they don't deserve ""tank man"" status. People in the West are always so quick to jump on China (similar to your comment about how there is always a critical sentiment in every Google post) but frequently people overlook the subtlety and complexity of how China actually operates. They simplify things or even ""dumb them down"" and then end up joining in the ""China is teh sux"" chorus without really understanding what they are saying.","1270086832"

We are not trying to trick her into giving up a kidney. She may very well be damn lucky to even go out on a date with the guy in question. There is a tragically distorted view when it comes to meeting and dating. Far too many pre-conceived judgements on the part of the woman which only makes the man feel like he can't just be himself but has to contend with all the contaminants in the woman's perception. Too often it sounds like the woman is 'sacrificing' something by giving a guy a chance and that only the man has anything to benefit. If i had my way and if more men had some spine it would be the women worrying about what they needed to say and whether or not they would come across as 'creepy'. Alas most men think with their penis so women will always feel they have the upper hand and that they are the 'deciders'- at least initially anyway.

That modern-day Christians have justified their lifestyles is besides the point.  I don't think Christians are bad people for maintaining a decent lifestyle.

As such, 24 hours in a day fits base-12, as does 60 seconds/minutes in a minute/hour (respectively). I think it's worth mentioning as a side note that the Babylonion's weren't exactly a stupid civilisation. They were the earliest people who studied the movement of the stars and the sun, and I think they had a hand in defining a circle to be 360 degrees (note: 360 works in base-12).

As to why we still use this system today? I dunno. What I find interesting (and I had to google this) is that the half period of a pendulum one metre in length on the Earth's surface is about one second.

"science","t5_mouw","I  massively disagree that there is as much dogma in scientific circles. Scientists are very eager to tear apart anything new, to look for flaws in an argument or methodology. If the evidence is solid it gets through such peer review and retesting. This is to be expected... if someone comes up to you and says 2+2=5, expect to be scoffed at. This is not dogma, however... it's only dogma if after this scoffing people don't look at _evidence_ that says otherwise.

Scientists are often eager to challenge accepted knowledge. They want to be the next Einstein to revolutionize the old Newtonian theories. They want to in recognition for exposing frauds such as the Piltdown man or for correcting mistakes such as the Nebraska man.

There are a few scientists that are dogmatic on some things, sure. But overall, not even close to the level you'll find outside of scientific disciplines. The scientific method in general also lessens the degree that this individual dogmatic attitude affects our knowledge. Scientists work very hard to reduce and eliminate individual bias in expected outcomes of studies. You can find exceptions, sure, but these are rare.

Behaving in a way that you perceive as rude is irrelevant to being dogmatic. Dogmatic is being unwilling to consider evidence or change your views. Scientists are overwhelmingly willing to consider evidence, and change their views if the evidence is strong enough. They are some of the least dogmatic people on the planet, as a whole.

Edit: I should also add that many (most?) scientific journals will submit articles to scientists in the field for peer review, and they will submit the articles anonymously to reduce bias against authors.","1270086969"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; not correct - even the OED supports it

Bullshit.  
The below is the OED's definition of ""agnostic"":  
""*agnostic A. sb.  One who holds that the existence of anything beyond and behind material phenomena is unknown and (so far as can be judged) unknowable, and especially that a First Cause and an unseen world are subjects of which we know nothing.*""

&gt; &gt; that origination and its etymology MUST inform its meaning in new contexts.

&gt; 'inform' does not mean control

In this case, the point is moot.  Otherwise I could decide at random that ""original"" is a color on the spectrum and if I got, say, thirty other people to say it was, as well, then we would be done.

And if someone who'd never run across the new usage were to see it in a sentence, well, it'd just be their problem that they didn't know it was a color and not ""relating to the source of"" as its etymology informs, eh?  After all; etymology only *informs* and thus has no control over the definition. 

&gt; So does mine - as I noted earlier, as far as I can tell, his words do not distinguish the two positions.

It absolutely does **NOT** conform to Huxley's usage and definition.  Huxley explicitly stated he was seeking a term that meant someone who did not know (or, moreover, **could not** know the answer.)  He was *VERY* explicit in this.  

The transmogrification of this meaning from that position to one being inclusive of ""undecided"" is simply a false act.

&gt; No, that's not the way words work - though it would be possible for a shift in the meaning of the word to take place, you as an individual do not have the power to effect that shift yourself.

Words have meanings because they have meanings.  And often-times, unlike with ""up"" or ""blue"", those meanings are derived from their composition.  Any person whom had never seen the specific term agnostic but was familiar with their cognates would have an innate, intrinsic understanding of the term as being ""a person without knowledge"".  

&gt; You are begging the question at issue or asserting your position.

&gt; Very well - an a-theist is someone who asserts a ""lack of"" ""deities."" Period.

No.  That is categorically false.  That would be an antitheist.

&gt; What about the trinary state of (1) asserts existence of god (2) asserts the non-existence and (3) asserts neither? Just as valid.

Assertion 2 and Assertion 3 are both not Assertion 1.  You either assert 1 or you do not assert 1.

Assertion one is theism.  Assertions 2 and 3 are atheism.

Theism/atheism is a binary choice.  It operates under the Law of Excluded Middles.

&gt; This is just the sort of thing that bugs me - this is a political move that's just as bad a the Xtians assuming that everyone is Xtian by default.

It is not a political move, sir, it is a definitionally true statement.  Consider:  ""All children are born not believing there is a god.""  That is factually true.  You could also make the equally true statement: ""All children are born agnostic.""  (""All children are born with no knowledge [of god(s)]."")

It is the definition of an apolitical statement.  (*Since you seem to be having trouble with that pesky prefix, in this case I'm saying that the statement lacks in political qualities.*)

The classes are terribly imbalanced, some are massively over powered(ie demoman's clip size) while others are terribly underpowered (ie medic's weapon health regen rate), there are a myriad of exploits that have stayed unpatched (ie blast radius damage extending through walls, or engies being able to build under the floor and in the sky) and there are only six maps (vs the thousands on the pc version) and the lack of unlock weapons effectively means there are less classes too(I mean eyelander+targe, huntsman, DR and arguably C&amp;D are all functionally new classes) Essentially every aspect of the game has been upgraded in some way. 

 I myself started out playing TF2 on the PS3, and I loved it, but after playing on the PC there is absolutely no way I could go back.

Freespace is a straight-up space sim. Freelancer is a fucking space-based third person shooter. From there being no sense of depth (in the Z plane I mean, look at it - everything is on the same level!) to the _very_ shootery controls it's so far removed from a space sim it's ridiculous.

Freespace has linear, script based, story driven missions and that's it. Freelancer has an open-ended universe with random missions and a trading mechanic blah blah. Even down to the basic gameplay it's nothing like Freespace. The only thing they have in common is that there's a fair amount of black in the background.

Look I like Freelancer a lot but to say it's anything like Freespace is an out-right lie.

If the OP or anyone else wants a game that's similar in gameplay to Freespace, that no one knows about, then I heartily recommend [Tachyon: The Fringe](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/tachyon-the-fringe).

If you want an actual space sim that's open-ended like Freelancer then shoot for [Independance War 2](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/independence-war-2-edge-of-chaos).

Still, I think the claim being made (while perhaps not fully conforming to the logical fallacy that is the ""No true Scotsman"" claim) is troubling because of its ubiquity and the inability of many of the claimants to use the same reasoning when similar circumstances are presented when including another religion. (I'm up now. I've had my coffee. ^^)

The easiest example is Islamic terrorism. They're rarely reported to be extremists as would be appropriate considering that no true follower of widely-accepted tenants of the Islamic faith absolutely forbid acts such as terrorism. Instead, they're ""Muslim terrorists."" And the degree to which our media seems to perpetuate these labels and yet go out of their way to downplay any similar actions from Christian extremists is enough that I think it's fair to call out individuals for doing precisely that.","1270087098"

"science","t5_mouw","Well then you'd know that too much phosphate causes yellow leaves. More plants die from too much nutrition than from inadequate trace elements in the soil/substrate. If you care to grow tomatoes, you can even taste when they've had too much nitrate. 

You may feel you're winning an argument here, but you're actually digging a deeper hole for yourself. You never even touched upon the interaction between different species (fauna AND flora). You're going on about how more CO2 isn't a problem, but yet you mix the figures from the atmospheric carbon cycle and that of water. There's a huge difference between the average 50 years carbon stays in the air and the short -term, very localized water vapour. 

A thick cloud cover also reflects sunlight. There is some evidence that global warming hasn't shown its full potential because of the added water in the atmosphere creating a temporary shading effect. This is only temporary though, it's merely a buffer. Once it's saturated, just like the natural carbon dissolution in our oceans, we get the full effect.

We're seeing methane releases from permafrost, indeed more water vapour, less ozon, more carbon etc - they're all part of this equation.

We've put a great deal of effort in banning the use of CFK's so that the ozon hole doesn't expand much more (though it'll take decades to grow back). Atmospheric carbon reduction is another goal.

Looking at this from a micro environment doesn't allow you to grasp the whole picture. I know CO2 is the media's devil, but so is acid rain, oestrogens in the water, too much fertilizers in the soil, species drift (foreign predators ruining eco systems) and heavy metal poisoning of groundwater tables. I'm worried about those too. Don't get me wrong, CO2 is just a piece of the puzzle.

If you've studies biology (and possible got a good grasp of chemistry) - why continue ignoring the actual science that's been done and stick to the lobby group talk?

You're the very kind of person that should be on the front line of the debate because you have the capability to actually read scientific journals. We're not talking about farms here, we're talking about the whole globe we're on. I'm not saying CO2 doesn't spur growth, but that's just industry talk.

The other big one is that I let my drunken confidence get away with me and made a move that was too bold.  There was a girl who I had kinda ended up in the friend zone with... one night while we were all drunk I chased after her when she left the bar earlier than expected.  Just as I caught up with her and called her name she was saying hello to 2 friends she'd run into.  I decided that I was so sure of myself I'd just ask her to dinner right in front of her friends.  Turned out she was less drunk than the rest of us, and she gave me a very uncomfortable ""sure"".","1270087152"

Life in prison offers potentially innocent people who would otherwise be dead a small chance at life.

It also shows a deeper understanding of the nature of crime from  economic, psychological and social perspectives and why some people commit it.  Eliminating the death penalty comes from the mentality that some people may be able to be rehabilitated.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I suffered from depression for about two years before I had similar thoughts. I watched all the things I valued in my life - education, relationships, my talents - fall to pieces. It was a slow, steady and horrible decline that I was only more then grateful to hate/blame myself for. 

Eventually what clicked is similar to what you have just said. One day I couldn't figure out what i hated more; my depression or that fact that I had let it take so much time from my life.

I'm 22 now. In 15 days I take my new-found perspective and move to a new state, start a new job and attend a new school (for the first time in 3  years). It feels a lot like being reborn and I find that i can't help being but being excited simply to feel *alive* again, to want to explore life rather than sink away from myself.

I'm glad all is well for you and hope you continue to feel better :) Good luck. I'm ending with a quote in which the original piece has absolutely nothing to do with this topic, but it has served as a source of strength for me. Maybe it'll do the same for you:

""...and perhaps there are those who simply, unapologetically, are flat-out scared. Scared of beauty. And of bliss. There are such people, and they have every right to their feelings and beliefs. I know, because I was, for most of my life, one of them. I am not one of them any more. I am not one of anything. I am, trite as it may sound, simply me, and here lately, that is more than enough. It is plenty. And there is something else, a secret: there are times, once a month, sometimes more or less, when the truth of that makes me, well, ecstatic."" ","1270087244"

If you attach the Blizzard name to something branded with a Blizzard franchise it will sell no matter what. Hell, we had a couple dozen guys lining up at midnight at the Wal-Mart by me for the release of World of Warcraft *Mountain Dew*.
It doesn't matter what they're developing, it doesn't matter who's developing it, and it doesn't matter what Blizzard tries to pull; their fans will still buy it in droves.

not manipulative at all! Here is a link to think upon http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/fashion/25love.html

As a manager, I got some coaching once.  If someone was disorganized, I would find the place they were organized and praise them about it in front of others.  It got their head into the place where they thought of themselves as organized (boss said so, right?) and they began striving for it as a ""grow the positive""  The net result was they got more money at the end of the year.  I was not manipulating them; I was helping them succeed.

I have been living in WA going on 14 years and I have never come across any hash amongst the few people that I know who toke.  

Anyways, it didn't really make a lot of hash and it tastes a little strange.  I have not smoked any real hash in about 14 years, so it's hard to say what i should ave expected.  Also, i used hot knives and even great weed tastes a lot different that way.  Later tonight I am going to try some in my vapor genie.

Spend a month researching and practicing writing a business plan. Find something you didn't think you could afford and learn the insides and out of it. Automotive repair shop? Retail store? Small bar/restaurant? When you feel confident about your business plan and your model, go find a mid-sized bank. Stay away from the BofA and the HSBC types. They suck. Walk into a regionally based bank (for NY, look at M&amp;T or First Niagara; research similar types in your state, 25-50 branches), that should give you good examples. See if the commercial loan officer has a good relationship with the local county IDA's and such. If you go in well prepared and having an Excel spread sheet demonstrating your five year projections (trust me, make the numbers work, black is all they want to see), you can use that 10k as your equity in a nice loan. Small bank takes 50%, County program takes 40%, and all you need to do is come up with the final 10% to make the loan happen. Think it out, show them they will get their money back, and your 10k becomes you equity contribution on a 100k loan. Now how much better a business can you come up with starting off with 100k as opposed to 10k? Rule #1 my friend; OPM, Other People's Money. That is your starting point. Next time, maybe a few years down the road, imagine the money you can get with a solid payment history and 30k equity. What can you do with 300K? Papa-in-law will love you. It is all in the planning.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Well, I don't know what you've done to lead her on, so I'm not sure how much of this guilt is justified. 

This is how I'd like you to respond to me, if I was your friend:

""I really appreciate your honesty. Your friendship is important to me and I care about you a lot. (If you're not that close, you could say ""I think you're rad and I like being friends with you."")

I don't see a romantic relationship in our future, but I want you to know that you shouldn't be embarrassed that you told me this. 

I'm not going to treat you differently. I'm still your friend and I don't want that to change. I'll understand, though, if you're sad and you don't want to see my face for a while. (If you've been on the other side of this situation before, make sure you tell her you understand what it's like because you've been in her shoes before.)

It makes me sad to make you sad. I don't want you to feel rejected, because I want us to be friends for a long time.""

Probably I'm projecting my own experiences on to your situation, as I've been in your friend's shoes before, but that's what I'd have liked to hear. 

Just be honest but be kind, and if you have it in you, go a little out of your way to reassure her that nothing has to change about your friendship, and that you still think she's fantastic. Be willing to swallow an evening of awkwardness, because by acting normal and not running away like a scared little boy, you will be reassuring her that you're not going to act weird around her or avoid her because she told you she has feelings for you.

Edit: PLEASE, for god's sake, do NOT have this conversation by SMS, Facebook or email. Just... don't.","1270087385"

* Learn your stuff and have an interest outside school about physics stuff.  Read a lot of articles.  It helps a lot conceptually if you have read about a topic before you learn it.  Also, physics isn't an easy major.  It's very math intensive, so get ready for lots of homework and studying, even if you are good at math.  Go as far as you can in high school, that way you will grasp the easy stuff fast.

* I think there were a couple in CompSci, if I remember correctly, and maybe a couple in Math for an undergrad degree, but there were very few elsewhere.  It was very saddening.  I had to settle for a psychology major :).  But don't let all that get you down.  I would love to see more female physicists.  Females give a different perspective on things that really open the eyes sometimes. 

* I've enjoyed physics my entire life.  I'm kind of a reductionist, so this is my way of finding the meaning to it all.

These conservatives are easy to set off into a fit of anger or a thought pattern of fear.  It is easier just to ignore them and let their mental viruses fester.  If you talk about politics at work, it can get you fired.  If you talk about politics at family gatherings, you can set off a conservative and ruin the atmosphere.  I honestly believe that the unspoken taboo on political discourse is why we can carry on working, talking, and living with our conservative fellow citizens whose ideas would destroy the nation if applied in full.

I think [Al Franken](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCNs7Zpqo98) and [Alan Greyson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhJ7M8o8W-Y) have shown us the proper way to talk to conservatives.

As far as the PZ article, I'm still mulling it over.  The fundamental problem I have is that he describes a hypothetical scenario that would have implications for life today.  Chromosomal abnormalities results in disorders, whereas the process he describes should result in distinct genetic lines with slightly varying degrees of chromosomal diversity.  I honestly don't know that's not the case, but I don't think it is.

The issue, in general, is that the bio related PhD's you describe operate from a strong set of a priori assumptions.  If you start with the certainty that evolution IS the way we got here, then you'll find evidence to support it, and tend to disregard evidence that doesn't fit the mold.  Christians do the same thing with their pet theories or specific theologies ... it's an artifact of our human nature.

As far as making someone like you look silly ... we both know that won't happen.  As a believer in God, I think He designed things so we *can't* determine either way with absolute certainty.  In the end, in my mind anyway, faith is required to hold either position with certainty.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well hypothetically, our only use for classy and attractive is for calculations similar to that of calculating ""clasically attractive"".  Now, the case for redefining the variables in this case is much stronger than that of the quadratic equation.  In this case, we have two separate values which are independently passed through 1-1 functions.

In your example of the quadratic equation, if m an n were both functions of a single variable (and the variable were different for m and n), it would make sense to separate them in the manner you showed, thus indicating the separate causes for the +- part, and the first part.  In this manner, m and n would be *fundamental* building blocks of our quadratic equation.  However, in your example, they both operate on smaller blocks, namely a, b, and c, thus giving an example of when variable reconciliation is *not* helpful.

In this case, I would assume that classiness and attractiveness are two arbitrary values, only useful for calculating more important functions, like classically attractive, or strangely creepy, etc.  Now in this case, incorperating a function which is often applied to it is standard practice.  In many machine learning examples, you deal with *log-likelyhood*.  Now, because you end up using the log of the likelyhood for a lot of calculations, you end up formulating everything in terms of ""log-likelyhood"", which then becomes the fundamental building block, not probability itself.  In the same way, I would like to treat exponential classiness and exponential attractiveness as the fundamental building blocks, because it causes the equation for classically attractive to better reflect the manner in which the two quantities are combined.","1270087440"

"math","t5_2qh0n","First of all, congratulations on getting sober.

Now I'm going to make my usual suggestion: there is a series of small white books written by I. M. Gel'fand and a varying group of collaborators, and published in English originally by Birkhauser.  They include _Algebra_ by Gel'fand and Shen, _Geometry_ by Alekseyevskaya and Gel'fand, _Trigonometry_ by Gel'fand and Saul, _The method of coordinates_ by Gel'fand, Glagoleva and Kirillov, and _Functions and graphs_ by Gel'fand, Glagoleva and Shnol.

These books were originally written for a Russian correspondence school, and so they are expositions of high school mathematics intended for students of all ages:  students who are able to develop some sophistication in reasoning, and not merely solve endless lists of drill exercises.  Drill is important -- don't get me wrong -- but as an adult student you need more active work on developing mathematical thinking and mathematical insight, or the drill is pointless.

Gel'fand was a master expositor of mathematics at all levels, and the books carry his stamp: they are conversational yet concise.  I highly recommend them.

Aim to get to a level where you can handle Apostol's two-volume _Calculus_.  Reddit's standard recommendation is Spivak, _Calculus_, rather than Apostol's book, but that's for budding pure mathematicians.  If what you want is a good comprehensive grasp of the first year (and some of the second) of undergraduate mathematics, Apostol will give you that all in one place, in a book that's still rigorous enough to be mathematically ethical.  They use Apostol in MIT's honors calculus course, 18.014/18.024.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Illegal immigrants wouldn't kill someone to keep them from going to the cops. The odds of some random Arizona rancher being able to identify some random Mexican guy sneaking across the border at night, in a line up two weeks later, are basically nil. Also, the percentage of illegals coming across carrying guns is... well, damn small. The coyotes leading them would probably have a gun, but aren't going to be killing people - it would instantly ruin their business by bringing down every law enforcement officer for 500 miles onto their little patch of desert.

So, who would have guns? And be willing to use them? And have a good reason to kill someone just for seeing them?

Drug gangs.

Most people know that Mexico is fighting hard against the drug gangs. And it's been bloody and nasty as hell.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;Quote bible to show it is not the source of morals

Might I also suggest (and sorry if this has already been said) recommending better guides for morality and ethics. The Analects of Confucius, the Bhagavad Gita, the writings of Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Kant, Harris, Ingersoll, Paine, Gandhi... The Nuremberg Principles &amp; Geneva Conventions... 

Here is something I wrote in a debate with someone recently:

&gt;Having only one guide is like only having one side of the story... even worse when that story is full of violence, intolerance, sexism, and homophobia, and merely borrows the good parts from traditions that had been well-established in the region for thousands of years already. Double worse when that guide has been altered significantly from its original form to serve the needs of those in power throughout history.

&gt;If we can identify the absurdities in that story and overlook or reinterpret them in a positive way using only our own cognition, then we clearly didn't need the guide to begin with. Assuming that you don't recognize the human authors of those guides, of course.

&gt;Morality is doing what's right, without having to be told - not doing what you're told, regardless of what's right. With or without religion, you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.

Edit: The context was my QOTD, consisting of the full text of [this](http://www.atheists.org/Atheism/). They responded ""What is the guide for which this knowledge is measured?"" to which I responded the above, including the Confucius, et al. part. I can paste her response to the above, and my following response if anyone's interested.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Food for thought:  ""Assholes"" may often have what I can call a *sort* of confidence, but if you compare one of them to a guy who is confident and has no need to try to be an asshole - or, even better,  a guy who rejects any desire to even *let* himself be an asshole - you will find two different kinds of confidence.

Real confidence is solid and has roots.  People with this kind of confidence find they have no reason to take part in social games of showmanship, bragging, or trying to imply by crudeness that they are somehow more interesting than everyone else because they are the bigger asshole.  Real confidence makes a person at ease and drastically lessens the need to advertise oneself.  People with solid confidence find it through all kinds of trials, you know?  It seems those people let themselves be tempered by the fire rather than hopping out of it.  The lucky people are raised to have real confidence and it serves them their whole lives, and when life tempers them they are ready.  The unlucky go through the fire and never had a choice, but they came out intact.  

The lesser sort of confidence is often just a bad paint job, and women fall for it routinely - as much as men fall for the things you find silly in other women.  It's almost a kind of ""token confidence"".  People with that are often (but not always) negative and opinionated, talking down about people and things they don't like, trying to sound like there are consequences to their disapproval - but it's all really just whining in disguise.  Some try to always sound positive, but their actions betray their negativity.  Assholes are always talked about as being confident because their type of confidence is more like makeup than armor.  People fall for it.  It looks tough, but it's a dime a dozen, and when that confidence is tested by all the things life springs on us, how deep does the well go?  Some come out with the real thing, some go on with the same attitude which really amounts to a coping strategy.  The distinction is real.  Look at the assholes, and you'll see a lot of coping going on.  Look at the women who date assholes for their token confidence, and how often they have reason to complain.  They're hoping to find the asshole who has real confidence and integrity underneath the bravado, instead of finding the real confidence minus the asshole.  One takes longer.

Some people base their confidence on the wrong things, too, which is why there are so many people who fall on the spectrum somewhere between the confident asshole who has to try, and the confident gentleman who has real backbone.  Once a person stops trying to lean on something shaky to stand up straight, they might find the real origin of their strengths.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I think you are presenting a false dichotomy, between hiring teachers and conducting a study. The OP was suggesting a massive increase in educational spending, we do not need to choose between research and billions worth of spending. When I said that I thought you might be right, but that I wasn't sure, I was trying to emphasize the fact that I have seen inconclusive evidence on the topic. It sounds plausible that decreasing class sizes, may be the best way to improve education, but I am unsure of where we begin to see decreasing returns. From what I have read on education, the picture is much more complex than class sizes. Also, the spending graph that I presented earlier was caused, in part, by decreasing class sizes. 

When we are talking about spending hundreds of billions of dollars, careful analysis is obligatory and preconcienved, anecdotal evidence, has little place. ","1270087527"

If you, as a guy, were to do that, she would immediately down-grade your value.  That's my opinion.  What kind of guy walks around smiling at people?   (of course, unless there is something really to smile about).  Women don't like men who do things for no reason.  In other words,  I don't think they like fake men.   Women make judgements about you quickly so depending on what they've seen in the 3 minutes or so of meeting them, they'll make a quick evaluation.  That evaluation may be incorrect a lot of times had they just spent a little more time getting to know you.   Women are bombarded with lots of requests for their time so they don't like to waste time. It's like on the junk mail we get.  I don't spend much time on things that don't look important.

&gt;Besides polls still overwhelmingly show americans want a single payer system. The excuse given to why a single payer system wasn't done first was it would torpedo the rest of the reforms in the compromise bill.

A good deal of people do want a public option but the hard fucked up fact is the GOP would not let this pass, and tie up the entire legislative agenda just as they did before. Not to mentioning the horrible possibility 
should they win in November.


&gt;Those other reforms are now law.

Yes they are.


&gt;There are no excuses left.

No there isn't but right now both sides are licking their wounds, the GOP is weakened and the Dems are vulnerable until they can further sell this new bill the the American people and regain some political capitol.


One day I think there will be a single payer system in this country but first we need sell the benefits of this bill to those not on board, and then expand on it in years with a public option. *Then* if that works we try single payer, it's gonna be baby steps.

From Wikipedia

    * Action thriller: In which the work often features a race against the clock, contains lots of violence, and an obvious antagonist. These films usually contain large amounts of guns, explosions, and large elaborate set pieces for the action to take place. These films often have elements of mystery films and crime films but these elements take a backseat to action. Notable examples are the James Bond films, The Transporter, and the Jason Bourne novels and films.
    * Conspiracy thriller: In which the hero/heroine confronts a large, powerful group of enemies whose true extent only he/she recognizes. The Chancellor Manuscript and The Aquitane Progression by Robert Ludlum fall into this category, as do films such as Three Days of the Condor, Capricorn One, JFK, and The Zero Option, based on the 1983 shootdown of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 carrying 269 people including Cong. Larry McDonald.
    * Crime thriller: This particular genre is a hybrid type of both crime films and thrillers that offers a suspenseful account of a successful or failed crime or crimes. These films often focus on the criminal(s) rather than a policeman. Crime thrillers usually emphasize action over psychological aspects. Central topics of these films include murders, robberies, chases, shootouts, and double-crosses are central ingredients. Some examples include The Killing, Seven, Reservoir Dogs, Inside Man, and The Asphalt Jungle.

I also just have to question people who weren't ""hooked"" by the opening CG. Beautiful, action-packed, tells you just enough to pique your interest. This really is the ""twitch"" generation; we can't put in a few hours of ""meh"" (because, really, the game is NOT torture) for a big pay off once you get deeper in. Yahtzee's five hours? Maybe, even though you're still not really that far in. But your one? This is literally the equivalent of playing 15 minutes of God of War 3 and saying you don't like it because you can't upgrade his weapons yet. What game did you think you were playing?

"gaming","t5_2qh03","In BKoAC you gather heroes that control armies of up to 100 soldiers (if you want more soldiers you need more heroes) and after playing for a while you get attached to the heroes. These heroes also have a tenancy to have personalities (giving gold to make them happy has more of an effect on some than others. especially when your master is similar or different in their personality to the hero. some heroes were even arrogant for no reason and weren't worth wasting your time trying to get. others just didn't like you and didn't want to work for you). Each hero has unique attributes and the difference between them is so huge that they become one of the most important features of warfare and even in building up prefectures. I have yet to find a game with that sort of detail and I would gladly spend time on a game that actually made me want to memorize over nearly 200 different character's attributes and personalities. I have always wanted a game that came even close.

Other games like nobunaga, RTK or Ghengis Khan never gave me anything to be attached to. They were just numbers of soldiers and countries. Many of them were just ""buy low, sell high"" games.

It used to be so fun to waste valuable soldiers just for the opportunity to capture heroes that you really wanted. Then if you weren't popular enough to convince them to join you, you just put them in jail for a while and see if that convinces them. Each captured hero was 100 soldiers that they couldn't buy and 100 soldiers that you could buy. A 200 soldier sway was an enormous swing in power","1270087710"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I don't get all the hate for Vanille.  It's obvious right from the get-go that something is going on with her.  Her odd behaviour and ""don't worry, let's just keep going"" attitude massively hint that she's up to something.  **Plus** she has one more action slot than the others - she leads the party briefly early on and has three, when the others don't get 3 until they become l'cie - a ma-hoo-sive hint that she was already a l'cie before the others were.

The vibe I got from Vanille early on was that she wasn't necessarily that perky, but was playing the part through sheer force of will in order to complete her focus.  She doesn't go through as much character development as I'd like later on in that sense, but with that idea in mind she was tolerable early on.

The other characters annoyed me far more.  Hope was just tragically snivelly, but didn't seem to be going through any sort of believable grieving process.  Snow was a posturing idiot and just plain poorly animated - he didn't just spout crap about being a hero, he also clenched his fists and struck really daft poses that looked manga-like, and didn't fit in with the otherwise-somewhat realistic look of things.

And the way none of the damn characters would communicate with one another, whatsoever, was infuriating.  Hope snivelled and muttered, Fang and Vanille wouldn't talk to each other - it felt like the story was being artificially drawn-out by spreading all the character interaction into very small chunks.

I'm still playing FFXIII, and the aspects of it that are good really shine.  But I think the critical consensus over time will be that it is an interesting but flawed game.","1270087734"

From the first E3 video to the US launch, Final Fantasy XIII has been all about flash and very light on the substance. People defended the game, criticized it for years, but ultimately we knew nothing about it. The fact that people extrapolated that the game will be better than the second coming of Jesus shows how impressionable Square Enix's consumer base is. Is it not surprising that Square Enix gave the consumers what they want?

Honestly I'm disappointed. I wanted a game that was deep like Final Fantasy Tactics. A game with replayability (all I could think about while playing was how little replayability this game has). Some sense of exploration not involving the progression of the main plot. The game makes you feel like you're not a part of the action, whether it's the battle engine or the fact that you're mostly sitting watching people carry on a conversation about stuff that no one has formally explained.","1270087761"

However, they aren't the most comfortable thing to wear, and you can see that even her black shirt could cause some cleavage to show on the right woman. A good portion of ""nice"" shirts are going to have a little bit of a lower neckline than a t-shirt, and sometimes that's enough to get cleavage. Though, perhaps my definition of ""showing cleavage"" is different from yours. Even if they don't, the majority of women's shirts are form fitting, which will also accentuate chests as well. Why do they wear shirts like that? Because wearing a tent isn't enjoyable either.

Women may wear low cut shirts because it's what they happen to find in their closet that day, they may wear them because they feel good in them, they may wear them because they like the attention or any other slew of options. Just because you fall into one of the categories doesn't mean you fall into all of them. I'm not saying its wrong either way, I don't think you should get mad at someone for looking at your chest if you're wearing a lower cut shirt, but hey, that's me and it doesn't make me feel uncomfortable.

That would be true if ""every time"" the couple had unprotected sex with internal ejaculation. Of course that is not going to happen. 

But you talk about money, so let's crunch the numbers. Let's say we're dealing with aspiring porn stars who have some sort or mortal objection to both the pull out method and condoms. Let's say they have unprotected sex every day for 30 days. At a rate of $30/ pill, that's $900 in a month. That's a lot of money. 

But abortion is definitely not free. 

An abortion during the first three months costs about $1,000, and if it's after three months, you're looking at more like $6,000-$8,000. 

That's a lot of pills. 

(It should be noted that no pharmacy would ever give someone even a few days of the morning after pill at the same time or in subsequent days. I'm pretty sure it works by preventing ovulation, so obviously taking it in successive days would be extremely dangerous.)","1270087838"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","By the way, in response to your ""unintended but not unforeseeable consequence"" issue, consider this response from Judith Jarvis Thomson:

&gt;For there are cases and cases, and the details make a difference. If the room is stuffy, and I therefore open a window to air it, and a burglar climbs in, it would be absurd to say, ""Ah, now he can stay, she's given him a right to the use of her house--for she is partially responsible for his presence there, having voluntarily done what enabled him to get in, in full knowledge that there are such things as burglars, and that burglars burgle.'' It would be still more absurd to say this if I had had bars installed outside my windows, precisely to prevent burglars from getting in, and a burglar got in only because of a defect in the bars. It remains equally absurd if we imagine it is not a burglar who climbs in, but an innocent person who blunders or falls in. Again, suppose it were like this: people-seeds drift about in the air like pollen, and if you open your windows, one may drift in and take root in your carpets or upholstery. You don't want children, so you fix up your windows with fine mesh screens, the very best you can buy. As can happen, however, and on very, very rare occasions does happen, one of the screens is defective, and a seed drifts in and takes root. Does the person-plant who now develops have a right to the use of your house? Surely not--despite the fact that you voluntarily opened your windows, you knowingly kept carpets and upholstered furniture, and you knew that screens were sometimes defective. Someone may argue that you are responsible for its rooting, that it does have a right to your house, because after all you could have lived out your life with bare floors and furniture, or with sealed windows and doors. But this won't do--for by the same token anyone can avoid a pregnancy due to rape by having a hysterectomy, or anyway by never leaving home without a (reliable!) army.","1270087854"

I've not had anyone react very strongly to this attitude in some time, but every so often someone will look upset when I say something(That idea sounds good if you don't think about it, but if you actually consider it for more than a few seconds it's an appalling concept for these 7 reasons...), it's not meant to be offensive, if my company is charging by the hour it's in the customers best interest to dump bad ideas as soon as possible, not hang around for 3 hours while I subtly try to get them to understand why their idea is bad without pointing out their idea would never work and could only cause damage.","1270087864"

But the ""protections"" typically make some people better off and others worse off.

Some delusions definitely got weird. Over time everything became incredibly interwoven, like a some sick twisted novel where I was the main character, or maybe just a character.

I think you've got the right approach in only thinking about it in broad ways. When I was early in recovering, and still able to become mildly psychotic, I found that one of my triggers was in fact thinking too deeply about my experiences. It's not a trigger anymore however because my meds help, plus I've been in a more sane state of mind for long enough that it doesn't feel like my memories are attached as strongly to my current state of mind. I realize that's not so clear, I guess to rephrase, it's simply to say that time heals all (or most) wounds.

Being extremely rational is very helpful in that state. However, one thing I've come to realize, and what brought me out of nihilism, is that I am a human being and I have feelings. Now that my feelings are closer to what is defined within the realms of normality, I allow myself to have them, and to analyze them, but not too deeply.","1270087938"

I'd still be playing if the axholes who control the rights to Descent (There's two groups, both unkeen to let anyone create Descent 4) relinquished and let someone develop Descent 4.

Sadly, all efforts have failed. At least three attempts have been made. Descent 4 turned into ""Red Faction"". Then there were at least 2 fan attempts to acquire to rights. Both failed.

Then there were other 6-DOF games in development. Most notably ""nTrap"" and ""Zero G Marines"". Both of which died when the games were playable. ARGH!

Then there are the Doom mods: ""Into Cerberon"" which even got so far as top get Tricording right, and included in the build. It is also DOA.

Finally, there was ""Core Decision"" another still-born project.

It seems that gamers today don't have the skills, the controllers (a mouse sucks for 6-DOF games) or the interest in Descent any more, and given that Outrage only ever sold 50,000 copies of Descent 3, and lost a bundle of money on it, the chances of a Descent 4 ever appearing are remote.

It was the only game I ever really loved; an FPS that did NOT have giblets, and didn't feel like murder - and a game you could show to kids without wondering if what you were showing them was acceptable of not.

Other games have help my attention for a little while: Tron 2, Ghostbusters, and a couple of others, but nothing ever grabbed me by the throat and made me play 6 hours solid in huge online killing sprees that ended at 4:00am.

I can when warranted. It's not warranted when people are making pithy one liners about how someone should ""suck it up"" and just go to a church, regardless of any of the concerns he has. If you want to be snarky and condescending you shouldn't need people to make your arguments for you.

&gt;So when people say ""You should go because [X]"" you see the only valid reading of that to be ""X is the one and only consideration anyone should consider"" as opposed to ""X is (generally) sufficient to outweigh your misgivings as an atheist""?

If there are other considerations then they should be addressed instead of dismissed offhand, as they were in this case.

&gt;But when you assume (oh, sorry - ""include as a premise"") that A is more harmful than B, then assessing harm is germaine to the argument.

What argument? I didn't make any argument based upon the fact that religion is more harmful than the KKK. I just mentioned it after I had already *pointed out the flaw* in the ""suck it up, make your family happy, it's only an hour"" argument. They bear no relation to one another.

&gt;important to your argument, 

What argument? It will probably take twice to sink in so:  I didn't make any argument based upon the fact that religion is more harmful than the KKK. I just mentioned it after I had already *pointed out the flaw* in the ""suck it up, make your family happy, it's only an hour"" argument. They bear no relation to one another.

&gt;I especially love how the fact that I disagree with how you argue your point has lead to continual harping on my ""ethical and moral ignorance"" when you know nothing about me that would justify such an attitude.

So now you're the victim them? After you mentioned something about how I needed to take Philosophy classes? It's not my fault I can talk your shit better than you can.

Anyway, it seems to me that Ynet is paraphrasing selected points from the same [1999](http://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm) platform that you link to. In particular the point you quote appears on the 1999 platform. The date 2008 on the Ynet website is just the date the article has been published.
On the other hand, when you read the [platforms](http://www.idi.org.il/elections_and_parties/Pages/parties_likud.aspx) at the  Israeli Democracy Institute, these points do not seem to appear in, say, the platforms of the last two elections
([2006](http://www.idi.org.il/elections_and_parties/Documents/halikud%20%2017.pdf) and [2009](http://www.idi.org.il/elections_and_parties/Documents/halikud%2018.pdf)). Since these platforms are only in Hebrew, all I can give you is my word that I didn't find any reference to, say, the 1999 point disallowing the establishment of an Arab Palestinian state west of the river. Add to that Bibi's Bar-Ilan talk where he agrees (in his own arguable terms) for a Palestinian state west to the river, and that 1999 platform, in my opinion, belongs to the past.","1270087976"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","And when the world dumps the dollar and perhaps flocks to SDRs or a neo-Yuan what will you say? What about the next ""USSR"" that will rival and eclipse America? It's not going to be ""very hard times first"", it's going to be the death of a standard of living for the rest of American's lives. Meanwhile the next hyperpower(s) will start growing their own ""fiscal holes"".

Once people reject the dollar there is no going back. America will be a slave shackled to debt while the infrastructure crumbles and it will be this way probably until we're old.  Why would we want to start this now? Why the fuck aren't Americans demanding we stop supporting Israel and disband military bases worldwide? We've spent so much money spreading death worldwide it's about to bankrupt us, and when the American people ask about public healthcare to heal sick Americans the right admonishes it like they're suddenly conservative. 

America will probably default and could collapse, and I believe in government spending money on certain things like infrastructure and in some other areas, but America is about to default because it's basically been spreading death worlwide.  They could have used the money for good but they spent it on evil and they want us to pay it back?!  It's unethical for us to pay taxes for this, but we don't talk about that do we?  Maybe we should.

I also think that when an artist or group has an overall concept for the album it can be listened to as a whole. Something like Thrice's Alchemy Index.

Most of us would consider someone an ""enemy"" if we perceived him/her to be in any way mean or antagonistic, like an ex-girl/boyfriend after a bad breakup, or that schoolteacher who made you stay after school for mouthing off. But none of us really have any enemies in the true sense -- mostly just people we dislike (or even hate) because they pissed us off at some point or were genuinely assholes towards us or someone we liked. I think an enemy should really be someone who wants you dead, and would actually take steps to make that happen; or vice-versa, someone you'd actually have to kill in order to fulfill your desire / career / objectives in life. Not just some victim of your misplaced emo bitch angst, which is what a lot of people now think of when they think ""enemy"". Now if you'll excuse me, I have to finish plotting my enemies' demise.

People like you are the reason why level-headed anti-war people aren't taken seriously.

The CIA is funded by taxpayers well enough.  They certainly do have a history, since their beginnings, of doing illegal and immoral things -- and of using illegal means of acquiring funding *when they have been at odds with the policy of other government agencies*.

The war itself has been massively more expensive than would ever be recouped by profits from the heroin trade.

The policy of the military, at first, was to **destroy** the poppy fields, but this turned out to be a stupid move.  Poppy cultivation really is the only means of making money for the honest farmers there.  So they've shifted their priorities.  It's a strategic move for security purposes, period.  It makes much more sense to penalize the actual corruption among warlords than on simple farmers.

Instead they treat us like slaves.  What is most disgusting is that they do absolutely nothing but look down on us. We should force them to work so that at least they bring something to the table, since all they do now is bathe in a luxurious lifestyle. What is it that do cats do that earns them their position at the top of the totem pole? Do they provide any extra security to a household? No. They actually tend to break ornaments, ruin couches and drapes, and even eat other pets. Do they provide us with food? No. These despicable creatures, in fact, tend to consume not just their share, but they steal from others in the household as well. Do they even provide entertainment? No. They smugly stare at us when asked to perform any task, as if they believe that they are inherently superior to us. It is time that this behavior is put to a stop. We humans have become subjects of cats, obeying their every need. We are allowing them to live like royalty while displaying not an ounce of gratitude. It is about time that we set some rules, and once and for all make it known that it is us, not them, who are in control. After all, we humans work our asses off to provide for them. For what? to please these diminutive charlatans without getting anything in return but a feeble dead mouse every once in a while? This is not a fair arrangement. I say it is enough! Do not tread on me cats! We the people demand to be treated as slaves, or as scum, not even as equals, but as superiors, for it is us that provide you with a bed, with food, with your scratching poles, and it is us who are left to care for your bastard kittens after your various sexcapades. Enough is enough.  
But that is not what angers me to the point where it has become unbearable. It is disgusting is that we willingly allow so many of these animals to treat us humans that way. But what is worst, worse than letting ourselves be stepped on and squashed like bugs, is that so many of us, particularly members of r/politics not only take this deplorable treatment willingly, but they vehemently defend the system which has allowed for this to go on for decades. It is disgusting. I hope that this post provided some balance to the cestpool of cat lovers here, even though it has absolutely nothing to do with the subject at hand.","1270088140"

Well for starters:

- The member with an actual scientific background voted against the whitewash, repeatedly,  as documented on pages 52-54.

- The report relegated [McIntyre's impossible-to-ignore submission](http://climateaudit.org/2010/03/31/tricking-the-committee/) to the footnotes and totally buried their heads in the sand on his points.

"Equality","t5_2qtp5","I think it's also hard for us to separate our own preconceived ideas from how we interpret what is threatening and what isn't. As the psychologist/expert/whoever said in the video, female violence can be seen as not as important or less of a big deal. There are points where she definitely looks kind of stupid and the opposite of threatening, but when I watched the video imagining that the genders were reversed, it came across as pretty intense at certain points.

Even if a guy is really scrawny and doesn't seem to pose a real threat to his girlfriend, I think people now rightfully see that physical abuse is also emotional/psychological abuse, even without harmful bodily injury. Even if it were a guy flailing ineffectually at his girlfriend, I think most people would see him as psychologically troubled and would probably worry for the girl, even if they don't step in.

Seeing all the people responding like it's just a woman acting out her hysteria or emotions and it'll be over soon and they'll get over it, etc. was really insulting. Are women not accountable for their actions because ""women get so emotional""? I feel like to a lot of people, her violence was the equivalent of a child throwing a tantrum.

The people being interviewed at the end laughing about how he probably cheated on her was a little bit disturbing. Haven't we learned that ""he/she probably deserved it"" is the last thing that should race through your mind when you see somebody being physically attacked?","1270088178"

He seems to have an authentic passion and purpose. Unlike most other characters his actions seem rational and his motivations genuine. The other characters seem to simply suffer the consequences of their often terrible choices, but Desmond's misfortune is almost entirely attributable to destiny, or whatever the driving force is behind the island, and in that way he lives out the archetypal reluctant hero better than anyone else.

   *Kelvin Inman*

However little we saw of him, I thought he was fascinating. He introduced Desmond to the Swan, was our first real introduction to the Dharma Initiative, was a comrade of Kate's father, essentially made Sayid who he is, and dies an unfortunate and untimely death at the hand's of perhaps the most innocent character of the show.

   *Jack Shephard*

I could fill this slot with a handful of characters and still give as many good reasons for why they should be my favorite, but being that he's the most developed character on the show and seems so integral to its conclusion, he takes precedent. Think of any significant plot point, character interaction, or disagreement between characters and it will be nearly impossible to avoid him.

I know I'm gonna get panned here as it seems there are quite a large number of gamers at reddit, but this issue has recently become close to my heart.  I feel more and more that my friends are becoming too obsessed with playing video games and it is interfering with their day to day lives.  Yes, we've all read the articles and documentaries on video game addicts and how they lose their jobs, etc... But i'm not even talking about that severe of a level.. Maybe I'm talking more about the 'functional addict', someone who holds down their job but is compelled every night to go home, sit on the couch, and play an RPG for hours on end.

I'm sorry but I dont feel like this lifestyle is productive or healthy. I realize that watching a movie isnt the most mentally aggressive activity either, but at the most we're talking about 2 hours out of your day, compared to the extremely high number of hours a serious gamer will put in.

Gosh, I dont want this to sound like I dont understand there are casual gamers out there.  I also am not calling for the burning of consoles....But after I attended PAX in boston, and the conversations I had with many people (many of whom had not been on a 'trip' or social outting for months, at times, years) I really started to feel weird about it all.

Video games, in my opinion, should not be held with the same regard as we do literature. They should not be thought to be as stimulating as films (keyword: films, as opposed to 'movie').  I dont know, I guess I just am growing nervous about how anxious many people seem to be at accepting that its ok for someone to sit on a couch for 6+hours a day leveling up a character.  I just dont believe that video games have THAT much merit to them.

Honestly, it doesn't matter what they're called, they were arrested and are in jail.  I'm not sure they are terrorists by a *strictly literal* definition; their goals were somewhat different, but in the end it doesn't matter.

I'd recommend you read ""The Silent Brotherhood"" which is a great book about this sort of thing.  They ended up killing someone too (a Jewish radio talk-show host).  This was all in the mid 1980s.  I know someone who was on their hit-list but he wasn't told by the FBI.  They didn't want leaks.  (He found out after everyone was arrested.)

Their purpose according to [Wikipedia](http://tinyurl.com/yl8ueef) was ""Paramilitary **formenting white nationalist revolution**, against what they call the **Zionist Occupation Government**.""

They created, or promoted, a lot of the rhetoric that inspired Timothy McVeigh (someone that nobody has a problem calling a terrorist).

Many of them subscribed to what's known as [Christian Identity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Identity).  It's fascinating stuff, and thoroughly dreadful.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; The materials they find offensive do, in most jurisdictions, must meet a certain additional definition: it must be racist, homophobic, inciting to hatred etc. Just feeling offended is not enough.

Unfortunately this is not true. In Australia, for example, the [classification code](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/LegislativeInstrument1.nsf/framelodgmentattachments/A4DD01BB110AD94DCA25700D002EF73E)  goes like this

&gt; 1.                Classification decisions are to give effect, as far as possible, to the following principles:

&gt;  (a)  adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want;
....

&gt;  (c)  everyone should be protected from exposure to unsolicited material that they find offensive; 
&gt; ....

This principle is embraced by many beyond the law. That is, it is a moral view that people hold and apply to suppress offensive speech. For example, some time ago The Chaser comedy team did [a sketch involving kids with cancer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZw2Z7LJqxw). The broadcasting management (of a government funded organisation) decided to suspend The Chaser for two weeks as a response to the offense that many people took.


&gt; The phrase ""No one has the right, not to be offended"" (without the ought) is an attempt to legitimize religious criticism and to acclimatize society to accepting such criticism in the face of years of political overcorrectness.

I take it you meant ""Everyone has the right not to be offended"". With that change we broadly agree.

&gt; Society needs to know that in the case of religion, feeling offense is not enough to allow invoking laws that grant protection against criticism or that punish those that offended.

We agree however that is too weak. Not only in the case of religion but in all cases feeling offense ought not be legal grounds suppression of speech (criticism or not). 

Furthermore, feeling offended ought not be moral grounds for suppressing speech. So, in an informal group discussion, say at a party, if Jack calls for Jill to silence her expression on the grounds that he is offended we should support Jill and not Jack. We do this by giving her the chance to fully express her point.

Many wrongly take the freedom to say what you think to be only a legal issue.","1270088313"

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","I'd start with getting a good grip on all the triad arpeggios, and once you've mastered that move on to seventh chord arpeggios. When you are soloing over jazz chord changes, improvise with the notes in the correct arpeggio for the chord. 

Once you've gotten good with using just those, you can start connecting the notes with chromatic notes. Even if you just know the major/minor arpeggios, this approach sounds pretty good. It's hard to get the transitions between chords down,  but keep at it!

As far as books go, you should pick up a copy of the Real Book. Any edition will do. It's a huge book of jazz standards, and it's great for working on sight reading as well as expanding your jazz knowledge. (If you don't know how to read music, learn! Until then, you can still use the chord progressions from the book, and try to learn melodies by ear)

Sam was a guy, who happened to *also* be from Seattle, who helped me get my bearings and gave me my first taste of real absinthe. He and his fiancee, Marketa, were waiting for her visa to come through to move back to the States. That happened around Xmas of 07. 

Fast forward to present day: I'm back a few months from my global gallivanting and waiting on the corner for a bus. I'm watching all the people in cars as they have to slow down for the intersection. I see this woman. She sees me. Then her eyes get really big. And I give her a funny look thinking ""You seem familiar."" Then she points at me and I go ""Hey yeah!"" The car is halfway around the corner and jerks to a stop as she motions to the driver. Having finally recognized Marketa, I run up to the car. It's her and Sam, who've just gotten back from the dog park and recently bought a house less than 2 miles from the place I moved into at the beginning of the month.","1270088448"

I didn't meet my dads dad until I was 17 and found out who my real father was.  My father had gotten brain cancer and was dying.  So finally my mom decided to tell me the truth and I left NC to see him in CA.  He had sort of an Awakening moment when he saw me because he was almost a vegetable before hand.  I didn't get much time with him but he told me that he really loved my mom even though he didn't marry her (he knew her since she was 13) and that he always told her that i was his kid and he knew it.  He was really cool and I wish I got more time with him.  I had to come back though to leave for boot camp and he died shortly after I left.  His dad was a stubborn old man who hated the fact that I existed (due to the conditions).  I love stories like yours because although I have never had those experiences I can use them to prepare to be a great father figure to my kids and their kids.

My best feat was when we redid our living room.  At the furniture store one day we saw a nice oriental carpet with gold, burgundy, cornflower (that's a pale blue), and a few other colors in it.  After a few days' discussion we decided we'd buy that rug and paint the walls to match the gold in it.  We went to the paint store and out of the thousand-or-so color chips I picked the one that best matched the carpet color as I remembered it.  A few days later we went back to the store with the rug, and THEY had picked out a chip by holding them up to the actual rug.  I had picked the exact same chip, out of thousands, from memory.

&gt; Anyone outraged that doctors see kids naked?

Of course not. Doctors are trained medical professionals who are personally accountable for their actions. TSA employees are faceless drones with no accreditation and no personal responsibility. Furthermore, doctors see you naked in order to provide a direct benefit to you. TSA employees see you naked in order to provide a benefit to *themselves*. And lastly, stripping in front of a doctor is completely optional – you can still get medical help without being naked. However, with these new scanners you cannot board a plane without having your privacy violated.

"business","t5_2qgzg","&gt;Woah, that's a lot of words explaining how you don't understand the Case-shiller index.

Well, if you believe Case-Shiller includes an inflation adjustment, you are sorely mistaken (which would mean it is you who don't understand it). Adjusting for inflation would corrupt the data and render the index pretty worthless.

Here's a quote from the [Case-Shiller FAQ](http://www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/pdf/index/SP_Case_Shiller_Home_Price_Indices_FAQ.pdf) -- right from the first item on page 1:

&gt;1. What do the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller1 Home Price Indices measure? The indices are designed to be a reliable and consistent benchmark of housing prices in the United States. Their purpose is to measure the average change in single-family home prices in a particular geographic market. The monthly indices cover 20 major metropolitan areas, which are also aggregated to form two composites – one an aggregation of 10 of the major metropolitan areas; the other including all 20. In addition, there are supplemental indices that cover 5 major condo markets. **The headline indices are not seasonally adjusted or adjusted for inflation.** Standard &amp; Poor's does publish supplemental data that includes seasonally-adjusted indices, tiered-price indices and sales pair counts. The seasonal adjustments are re-estimated every month.

BTW, for those interested here is a link to the [S&amp;P/Case-Shiller page](http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-case-shiller-home-price-indices/en/us/?indexId=spusa-cashpidff--p-us----) where you can find addition documents, including a abbreviated 2 page PDF ""fact sheet"" and a detailed document on the methodology.

---

Edit: Oh, and for those who want to see an version of the Case-Shiller Index that **has** been adjusted for inflation (well, at least to ""CPI"" inflation data by the NYTimes through early 2007), [look here](http://bubblemeter.blogspot.com/2007/09/housing-graph-case-shiller-index.html) and then note the significant differences between that and the chart on the OP's article (mainly the ""convex"" curve from 1990 to 2000 whereas the standard C-S chart shows that time period as the ""hockey stick"" typical of exponential nominal data {i.e. monetary inflation}).","1270088570"

&gt;In its most general formulation it is a theory of abstract operators  acting on an abstract state space, where the observables represent physically-observable quantities and the state space represents the possible states of the system under study. Furthermore, each observable corresponds, in a technical sense, to the classical idea of a degree of freedom. For instance, the fundamental observables associated with the motion of a single particle are the position and momentum operators.

Unless you are versed in QFT or QM that may not mean much to you. One uses language in a context appropriate way. 

It would be far more unusual to use long hand descriptions where the short hand would suffice. ""His Word"" inveigles the concept of all Biblical scripture as being originated with God and also the concept of Jesus as the *logos* and wraps it neatly into the shorthand for ""studying a passage of Biblical scripture"", aka ""in His Word"".

The apartment building I was in was referred to as the ""Animal house"" because everyone who lived there had big pets and crazy parties. I kept to myself most of the time, but my neighbours were constantly in domestic violence-related situations. They were always drunk, and the female of the two was always bruised. I could hear him beat the shit out of her, and I would call the cops every time. They would come, she would make some excuse for her boyfriend, and they would leave. This happened probably five times before one night when the guy next door knocked on my door. I opened it to find him pointing a gun at me. Pretty much scared the fucking life out of me. 
I closed the door, locked it, stayed low to the ground and called the cops. He was rambling something on and eventually got arrested that night.

&gt;That's different. Your dog's moral nature is its own; you've just imposed arbitrary restrictions on it.

That's what religion does.  It imposes restrictions on what would otherwise be mankind's natural morality.

&gt;scripture tells us that our moral nature is literally derived from god's; ie, our moral intuition is merely part of god's moral intuition. 

Citation needed. Religious morality may be from god, but it doesn't mean it's the same morality that applies to god.

&gt;(Also, for the 'same rule to apply' to you, you'd have to not shit on the carpet, so I don't really get what you're going for there.)

You're looking at the wrong part.  It's not about not shitting on the carpet, it's about shitting on the lawn specifically.

Your following dissection of my statement is completely unnecessary by the majority of readers.  I can read it perfectly fine and I'm fairly sure most others can as well.  You just reword it into words that you prefer.  It's not clarification.  It's rewording.

I obviously am referring to both moralities in what is referred to in holy books, it's not a matter of dividing, but to say that God's will supersedes the moral laws that he hands down to us.

You're just failing to differentiate between morality as it applies to God's actions to as it applies to our own actions.

To put it into one sentence: The morality applies to God differently than it applies to his followers because he is under a different set of circumstances. ","1270088745"

"history","t5_2qh53","He was also a right-wing zealot who from the very beginning was also ultra-nationalist, xenophobic, anti-semitic, and homophobic among other things.  This was obvious from Mein Kampf.  He opposed unionism and considered any grass-roots organisation with an international outlook as anti-german communism.   

The fact that he managed to fool a great number of people in his early years does not take away from the fact that many understood very well what he was about from the very beginning.  Many understood what the nature of right-wing reaction was, even if mainstream political leaders did not (or pretended not to).  People like Karl Kautsky, Emma Goldman, Leon Trotsky (political leanings notwithstanding) warned of the oncoming disaster long before the rest of the world woke up.  Even Rosa Luxemburg, and Karl Liebknecht, who both died murdered in 1919, warned that right-wing reaction in Weimar would result in a descent into barbarism.

In addition, you would have had to be blind to overlook his association with Mussolini, who had annexed Ethiopia in the 20s in a typical fascist thumbing of the nose to the rest of the world.  Also, you would have had to have your head in the sand to ignore his association with Franco, and Hitler's part in sending the Luftwaffe to bomb republican civilians in Guernica during the Spanish Civil War in the 30s.

The only people who acted surprised at Hitler's invasion of Poland were those who were happy enough to see *others* crushed by the fascist boot, just as long as they themselves weren't threatened.

The Empire brought peace to the turbulent galaxy.  Before, the government was paralyzed.  For example, Naboo was faced with a blatant invasion and paralyzed trade routes so what does the government of the Republic do?   It's raining battle droids on Naboo and they create a fucking committee.  I bet the approval ratings for the Senate were as high as the US Congress.  The Republic was so bureaucratic and cumbersome that it couldn't even protect it's own citizens.

With stability comes trade.  And with trade comes prosperity.  With prosperity comes happiness.  

Was the Empire perfect, no.  But it's hard not to be happy with food in your stomach, ready access to bacta, and 2 landspeeders in your garage.

Edit:  All this talk about racism in the Empire is just plain incorrect.  For example,  while it is true that there are Wookie prisoners they are not ""slaves"" by any approximation of the word.  These Wookies are criminals plain and simple.  This is further evidenced by the famous Chewbacca, whose livelihood was solely based on illegal and criminal activity.  This is a fact and not contested anywhere.  Additionally this glossed over 'hero' is also extremely violent.

And I think most people would likely agree that we, as individuals, have been lead astray by opinions which we've later abandoned. After all, it would be remarkable to *always* make the correct decision based on any given circumstance. 

All of that, to me, sounds extremely obvious. But I still catch myself talking past others I argue with. What's up with that? It's as though I'm saying ""Yeah, but my experience is *better* than yours,"" though that would be a ridiculous claim to make. It's a relatively bad day when I don't learn something new.

So if there's a solution to change the tone of religious discussions, I think it would include a greater appreciation for the breadth of human experience. Those who we argue with have completely different experiences than our own, and there is no reason I can think of why any of us need to *assume* it's inferior.

In American terms it was very poor, however relative to other rural places in Morocco I would say it was just a little below average. Just about everyone had the necessities (food, shelter, etc.) and many families even had tv, but other luxuries were very rare.

The kids did not speak very much english at all. Most of them were in school full time, but the kids that made it as far as high school boarded in another town about an hour away. Schools don't teach english until the high school level so the kids that were in my town had not had any formal english lessons.","1270088895"

1) Recon is NOT a sniper.  You have a sniper rifle but your main role is to spot, throw recon balls (motion sensors), and blow up vehicles/MCOMS with C4.  Sniping is secondary to spotting and assisting the team, because sniping is rarely SUPER helpful.

2) You can jump right into it with the base gun of every class -- the base weapons suck, but you'll upgrade fast.  You need to accrue points to get the cool stuff: ammo packs, health packs, sights, defib paddles, mortar strikes, repair tool, better rockets, etc.  So your main job, at first, is to kill people.  You are at a disadvantage but it's not insurmountable.  Play in a squad, work together, and you will be fine and leveling up in no time.

3) As a medic, you have to level up and unlock health kits and paddles, you don't start with them (same for every class):  See above.  Med Kits on the ground mean other medics have dropped them.  You don't have to pick them up or do anything special to use them, stand on/near them and if you need to be healed, you will heal.  Same with Ammo Kits.

4) The key is team work.  Don't try and lone-wolf it.  Your experience will suck.  Pick a class and commit to leveling it until you unlock the fun stuff... Assault: your sights and ammo packs.  Engineer: mines, upgraded rocket launcher, and repair tool. Medic: med kit, defib paddles, and the M60 (the god weapon in this game). Recon: mortar strikes and upgraded scopes.","1270088897"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There is no such thing as a T1 in Australia, we, like most of the world use the E1 classification, which is a bundle of 32 PRI circuits running at 64kbps each (E1 2mbps vs T1 1.5mbps). Currently I pay for an E2 connection which is a bundle of 128 PRI circuits running at 64kbps(8mbps vs a T2 6mbps) with a 100gb cap per month, and that costs $130 per month.

 The problem is that Telstra rolls out RIMs(referred to as DLCs in the US) far too frequently, Indeed my local exchange has the highest number of rims in Australia. Which means there is a single E2 connection which is split up among six streets and then at each street it is split up again among everyone on the street. So effectively we are all paying for E2 connections, and if not many other people are using it, yeah, we might get E1 speeds, but when everyone is online at once (peak times), we have a single E2 line shared between hundreds and hundreds of people. So not only is it slow, it is also intermittent as demand ebbs and flows, and due to all that splitting we have a packet loss rate of about 50% and a ping of 600ms to the center of town. 

 As far as paying for a fibre optic connection, you can't just ask for one, even if you were willing to pay for it. either a telco decides to build one for you, or they don't. But even if I lived right next to an exchange and got the fastest possible home user speed of 24mbs (about half a T3), the largest possible plan you can be on in Australia is 240gb a month, meaning you can reach your cap for the month in under 3 days. 

 There are telcos who try to compete, they build local networks and provide unmetered downloads of their mirrored content, but if you want to send data between cities, you have to rent bandwidth of Telstra, and if you want to make it out of the country, well there are only five undersea cables out of the country and Telstra owns four of them (the other one only just opened), so you have to rent bandwidth off Telstra. Because they have such an absolute monopoly, they essentially set the price of data at whatever arbitrary rate they want. 

 And as bad as it sounds, they are actually pretty generous when it comes to home connections, mobile phone data..  now that is daylight robbery. Say you had an iphone and you wanted to browse the net on it, you could buy chunks of data from Telstra at the following rates: $5 for 5mb $10 for 100mb $29 for 200mb or $59 for 750mb.  For less than that you could get an unlimited plan in the US. There is no such thing as unlimited in Australia, and both uploads and downloads count toward your total, hence why australians so rarely seed torrents.  Also, our rates are asymetric, so if you have a 8mbs download rate, you only get a 512kbs upload.

I suppose that you expect to actually download torrents. Which means, a lot of traffic through the network, easy to detect.

"badcompany2","t5_2rgyt","It just depends on your play style. Recon can be a bit tricky for a newbie and chances are that you're not actually adding anything to your team until you learn more of the mechanics of the game.

* Join a squad. You can spawn on your squadmates. Often times a single good squad can turn a game around. 
* Spot using 'Q' (select on PS3, back on XBOX). This is invaluable. The longer you keep the spotted enemy in your sights the longer the orange cone will remain about their heads.
* Get a headset. Communication is key in this game and hardly anyone seems to use this feature. If you and your squad have open communication you will more than likely win 80% of your matches.

* Everything has to be unlocked. Better guns, ammo kits, repair tool, health kits, etc... You unlock these things by gaining XP which you get from completing objectives such as arming/disarming MCOM stations, capturing a flag, killing an enemy, etc. As a medic, keep helping your squadmates by spotting, killing and defending with your LMG.
* The LMG for the medic is worthless while moving. Try to take cover when firing so you can remain stationary.

I could go on and on but you're best bet is to read around the posts on this subreddit and learn by playing.

P.S. If you're playing on PC, search for the Reddit servers (it's case sensitive). There are probably a lot of people willing to help you out. Protip: Get on mumble if you want help from these guys. It's far too difficult to type/text during a match.

The more you play the more you will understand. Also, when you get the time, join an empty server that's on a map that has helicopters and learn to fly. Trying to fly during a ranked match is the one of the more annoying things that happens in public games.

Because I'm the former.  And I thought I would be.  If your little boy shows signs of being feminine or homosexual or whatever, embrace it...and I'm fine with that.  Make him understand that he should be who he is, and doesn't need to change because of any outside influence.  But to criticize parents for treating a boy with the assumption that he'll be in the great majority of boys - that's silly.  I'm not saying that traditional gender roles are the only way to live, or should be touted as superior, but operating under the idea that your child could be a gay transsexual is like prepping a child to be prepared to die of cancer.

If the signs arise, then you act.  But complaining about a father who chuckles at his extremely young son, who has no idea about what anything means, singing about being a single lady is ridiculous.  It's just as needlessly extreme as the homophobic behavior of the parents that made people sensitive about this in the first place.","1270088966"

Usually earning profit means ensuring that your company's products or services do not hurt your customers; however, when the goal of profit maximization and customer protection clash, then the company will probably choose to harm the customer if they do not have ethical decision makers and if they feel they can get away with it.

JGailor's point is really quite valid. It doesn't really matter what the *salaries* of the employees at government regulators are. If funding of the regulators has been falling or increasing at a rate less than inflation, then the actual amount of inspection that can occur will necessarily decrease.

Manufacturers, for instance, are supposed to keep track of accidents/failures involving their products so that they can notice any statistically high rates of failures, investigate them, and issue a recall if necessary. Of course, they won't if the failure rate isn't high enough or if the problems can be explained away. 

Oftentimes, insurance companies will step in a let the NHTSA know when a certain product is correlated with a high number of failures or accidents (which indicate tha tthere might be a problem). Of course, if the government regulator has a lot on its plate already, its unlikely that they will put much effort into investigating something that's suggested by a statistical observation.

I hope I am not wrong...

EDIT:
After looking some stuff up, I was wrong. Activision could in fact boss Blizzard around if they wanted. Although Mike had talked to Kotick extensively prior to the deal and Vivendi did as well and the agreement was for Blizzard to be completely independent. Activision could push in and try and push people around, but it would piss off the owners of the company (Vivendi) and it would piss off the most successful developer in the company (Blizzard). So, they won't do it. It looks like Mike was reporting directly to Kotick before, and maybe he is getting lazy or something, because he just put an extra level of management between the two. Odds are this will amount to no changes as Vivendi will not want Kotick killing Blizzard the way he killed Infinity Ward.","1270089082"

I think the best advice I can give you is: understand maths really well. I found studying physics easy because of my maths skills. 

If the university you go to is like mine, then first year physics will be pretty boring compared to the other years, so don't get discouraged by it. It'll be filled with people who aren't interested in physics, but need it for their course. As you get further along, not only do the topics you study get better, but your fellow students will actually be as enthusiastic about physics as you are, so there's a great feeling of camaraderie. Now, I know you said you want to study theoretical physics, but the experimental side gets progressively more awesome each year. In first year the experiments you do are pretty lame, but further on it's all high-powered lasers, supercomputers and calcium guns. 

As for the number of women studying physics, it was about 30% women in my classes. ","1270089084"

I feel silly needing confirmation that they consider this, but I want to hear it from someone.

To briefly answer your question, yes it absolutely is possible. First of all, drug laws as you currently know them won't be around for long imo. Penalties for Marijuana use have been watered down tremendously, and it's only a matter of time before they're done away with completely. (the harder drugs like Cocaine... that's a different story).

With that said, you have to be willing to uphold the law, not what you personally *think* should be the law. In our society, the legislature writes the law, and law enforcement well.. enforces the law. You also have discretion.. you're not *required* to arrest a college student you find with a small bag of weed, just like you don't have to ticket every driver that turns without signaling. But I guarantee you that if you write on your application or during your polygraph that you are unwilling to arrest for certain offenses (including drugs), you'll be eliminated.

I believe there should be a no questions asked time limit for abortions once the pregnancy is discovered, and if the women is shown to commit to the child, she should then be legally required to protect it.  Life isn't inherently sacred, and reproducing isn't a miracle.  If we can get over the objectiveness and sit down and discuss what works well for society, we'll have laws that eliminate both unwanted children and unsafe backstreet abortions.","1270089141"

"howto","t5_2qh69","I am currently running XP again.  This is why:

X-Fi drivers - ALL of them - even custom ones, SUCK HARD on Win7 x64.  They either crash games, or output a garbled mess every now and again, probably caused by some sort of memory overflow with the completely new sound engine.  This likely will never be fixed - even the creator of PAX seems to think it's fully fixed at each new release, and it has persisted endlessly in my machine.  It has been enough to drive me back to XP for now until I can buy another sound card. 

My PS2 controller adapter has no driver that Win7 works with (I did buy two more just recently that work perfectly, however, so I guess I can just be American and throw away some more plastic - or keep the old one around my netbook since it still runs XP).  

Deus Ex has mouse algorithm problems that are, as to my knowledge, not fixable in Win7.

I haven't been able to get System Shock 2 working without crashing to my desktop - every time I end up tweaking config files and downloading custom loaders for an entire day, but I've never actually had it working.

Steam games seem to crash more often in Win7 x64, at least for me, than they do on x86 XP.

That said, these are my primary few gripes.  I otherwise LOVE the new operating system and definitely miss its new features immensely since I sold my Intel 160GB G2 SSD in December.

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","The only reason I threw that ""18th century or 21st century"" piece in there is precisely because of your ""what decade are you living in"" question. It was a direct response to that statement. While the level of sex required for someone to be considered promiscuous may have risen from the 18th century to now that has no bearing on the definition of the word tart. You said it yourself, to be a tart means ""to practice promiscuous sex"". A promiscuous woman by 18th century standards was a tart, as is a promiscuous woman by this century's standards. The standards of promiscuity may have changed, but the definition of a tart has not. It meant that then and it means that now. I said a tart is a tart, not 18th century promiscuity is 21st century promiscuity. I did not mean to imply that a tart by 18th century standards of promiscuity is a tart by 21st century standards, simply that the definition was the same then as it is now. Thus, you're whole tangent on how what makes someone promiscuous differs from era to era and culture to culture, while correct, is irrelevant.

As for why I've ascertained that you are upset, it is because of the shear amount of posts you've made to multiple people concerning this word. I have no strong feelings either way. I have no vested interest in this discussion, nor do I have any ulterior motive to paint you as emotional. That's simply the tone I got from reading your responses to myself and others.

And as for how I know she is promiscuous, I don't have personal knowledge, but she's is rather well known for such behavior. Just do a Google search on her. Sure, a lot of it is tabloids and what have you, but there's not a lot of claims to the contrary, either.

So, in a nutshell, everything I have written on this subject boils down to this: Yes, she is a tart because she has sex with people, as that is the definition of a tart. I construed your original comments as you being upset because you were arguing with so many people over the word. I assumed you were upset because you thought the OP was calling someone a tart for a single act of sex, because I could not see why someone would be upset for otherwise calling an apple an apple.","1270089249"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Harvard is well known for inflating grades

Ummm, 1L grades are CURVED. Just ask your Harvard Law grad friends!

Or just read your own link:

""The top 10% of the class, excluding summa, are honored with the distinction of graduating magna cum laude. ""

How is Harvard calculating the ""top 10% of the class,"" alieneggsac? Don't percentile rankings imply that grades have a standardized numerical distribution. [Wikipedia seems to think so](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile_rank)

And let's hear your theory as to how ""half the class"" could have ""got Summa"" when only the top 10% gets magna. Let's not forget that there are many years when no one at Harvard gets summa. Note that Richard Posner, the Senior Lecturer who according to you must be unqualified to teach con law, graduated first in his class at Harvard but was not summa.

Your second link says nothing about the law school. Law schools don't grade like undergrad colleges. The vast majority of law schools curve 1L grades. Including Harvard. Harvard also curves 2L and 3L classes with more than a certain number of students. Law Review selections are made on the basis of 1L grades. Grade cutoffs for HLR fall around the 93rd percentile. So Obama almost certainly did better than 93% of classmates during 1L and obviously did better than 90% of them overall.

Oh, and LS exams are graded anonymously. Again, your imaginary HLS grad friends will confirm this.

So to sum up, according to your own link it is virtually certain that Obama got better grades than 90% of a group of law students who, in general, are in the 99th percentile of all law students nationwide. He was literally among the best of the very best. 

And yet you maintain that he's unqualified to explain the reasoning behind Ex parte McCardle to a bunch of clueless 1Ls. I wonder why on earth University of Chicago might have thought otherwise.

Finally, your HLS link is out of date. Harvard Law has a different grading system now. I'm surprised your friends didn't tell you this.","1270089279"

"programming","t5_2fwo","%20 rather than &amp;20, but to answer the actual question, I think the best way of looking at is that the space -&gt; + transform is a bug.

Back in the day when this was being put together nobody was using file specifications with spaces in them -- after all, half of the software you'd want to use did all sorts of horrid random things if you had spaces in file names (this is mostly sorted out these days, but there are still some weirdness in dark corners).

So although spaces in filenames were rare, spaces in GET submissions were not and it was just felt that %20 was too ugly for something so common so the + was picked as an easier to read alternative. The confusion that this might cause wasn't anticipated though, or if it was then it wasn't given enough weight.

These days you can safely use spaces pretty much everywhere, but you cannot use + signs in URLs because too many systems are broken in their handling of them. Even if you correctly encode them as %2B some systems will go so far as to decode that to a + and then replace that with a space which it will re-encode as a %20 before requesting the URL back from your server.

We a dope bonfire and got shit faced. I was laying game on some chick and shit was looking tight. It started pissing down rain so we all had to get into our tents and shit. I was pretty wasted at this point but my mac mode was on full force. 

So I go into the tent with that chick tent with like 5 other people. It was dark as fuck so I knew that hooking up was possible and that a finger bang was very possible. But she just got all unreceptive and shit and it made no fucking sense. I kept on drinking and reverted back to small talk. Eventually I just started being a desperate slob and basically said something like ""I know you wanna kiss me, yo. It's aight."" or some shit. It fucking turns out I got in the wrong fucking tent. The chick I was laying the flow on was sitting right next to her boyfriend. He was like ""Dude, she is my girlfriend!"" . I apologized and just went to sleep. 

Next thing I know I am standing outside of the tent in pouring rain. I just kinda figured I sleepwalked or went out side to puke. I shrug it off and go back into the tent and sleep. The next morning the dude is obviously angry at me but his girl keeps smiling at me, like almost laughing. I pretend like I forgot I was trying to madd dog his chick and just acted like nothing happened. However, everyone is giving me this odd look, like kind of ""WTF?!"" mixed with a smile. I realized what I did but I didn't think it was *that* big of a deal and plus I was telling everyone I ""blacked out"" when it started raining.

Well on the ride back to my friends place I ask my friend what the fuck was everyone's problem. It turns out that I fucking pissed on the girl's boyfriend, like all on him and only him. I ended up apologizing to the dude on facebook and shit was cool after that.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Erotic Plasticity: 

Baumeister, R., Department of Psychology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA

&gt; Erotic plasticity refers to the degree to which the sex drive is shaped by social, cultural, and situational forces. The core idea is that women have more erotic plasticity than men; in other words, female sexuality is relatively more cultural, whereas male sexuality is more natural. As evidence, individual women exhibit more change across time in their sexual responses; most specific sociocultural variable have larger effects on women than men; and general attitudes are less closely linked to specific behaviors for women than men (indicating greater context-specific responding).

In short, erotic plasticity means we are more attracted to people if we like their personality. This usually only works for women, because if a man isn't so attractive but has a great personality, his personality overrides his (un)attractiveness.

"Equality","t5_2qtp5","As I recall there was a lot of outcry about violence in video games. 

If I were to venture a guess it might be that in games with violence you have an opponent they fight back you kill them or you just kill them and move on. In this video game victimization and how horrible you can make the act *is* the point. 

Looking at the content:

""With the click of your mouse, you can grope her and lift her skirt. Then you can follow her aboard the train, assaulting her sister and her mother.

As you continue to play, ""friends"" join in and in a series of graphic, interactive scenes, you can corner the women, rape them again and again. The game allows you to even impregnate a girl and urge her to have an abortion""

These acts seem both physically and psychologically violent. In other video games where you can maim and hurt innocents or non-opponents the drawn-out torture is equally disturbing and usually part of a larger plot. 

I suppose my answer is that they are treated differently because they are different. The courts, for example, will look at the level of violence, the amount of pain and suffering the victim experiences, the intentions of the perpetrator etc...when considering severity of a violent act. Why shouldn't that be the case?","1270089415"

Yeah, there are a lot of people out there who buy the pro-Union side of the story, usually because that's all they ever hear. That's why so many people think Lincoln was one of our great presidents when in reality he was worse than Bush. He was easily the worst, considering how much he trashed the Constitution and how much he fucked up the country (and conquered another). 

&gt;Fighting to preserve the Union is like punching someone to say you love them.

Hahahahh! That's pretty great. Unfortunately it was more like beating your wife because she tried to leave you because you were constantly harassing her and making her life miserable. 

&gt;What would have been so wrong with the South seceding?

The burgeoning American empire would have had competition, and that would have been bad. But yeah, there's no logical reason the South shouldn't have been allowed to go their own separate way. Anyone who says otherwise would be arguing against the very same principles the Founding Fathers cited from seceding from the British empire.

&gt;Slavery's bad, sure, but that was an afterthought.

Very true, yet very rarely taught in school. Most teachers are too lazy to or too ignorant to (or specifically told not to) teach any of the actual history. They just say ""it was all about slavery, so the government must have been right"". Luckily for me I went to a college with some really good history professors so I was exposed to much more information about the whole thing.

Don't bag on something because you don't like it, and don't spout ignorant shit about how someone doesn't play ""real"" games. You shouldn't expect everyone to like the same things you do because that just doesn't happen. I personally enjoy Valve's games and I would go so far as to call them masterful within their genres. However, I also enjoy Square Enix's games and turn-based (or otherwise) RPG's in general. I'm sorry if that doesn't play into your little elitist bubble of what games are ""good"" or ""bad"", but that's reality. People are different and like different things, that's just how things work. To think you're better than someone else because of a difference of opinion is just narrow-minded. Fuck Final Fantasy? Fuck you, sir.

* Nori is the seaweed traditionally used to roll sushi. Any vegan sushi recipe will do.

* Kombu is great for de-gassing beans and making them taste better. Throw in a 3-inch piece with a pot of beans, and discard when finished cooking.

* Dulse supposedly tastes like bacon when you pan fry it (carefully!). You can also eat it straight (after checking for shells and crystallized salts and rinsing if necessary).

* I use kelp granules instead of salt in a lot of my savory cooking. Adds extra iodine and nutrition and keeps the sodium down.

* Wakame/arame is the most common seaweed variety used in miso soup. Make a dashi broth by boiling kombu and diced shiitake mushrooms in water briefly (2-3 minutes?), take out the kombu, add minced tofu and chopped wakame leaves, then turn off the heat and add scallions and miso to taste. Yum yum!

* Reconstituted hijiki makes a nice salad with julienned carrots and sesame seeds. Wakame is the variety traditionally used in Japanese seaweed salad.

* Bladderwrack tea is supposedly very good for you.

* Potatoes and seaweed go well together.

* Irish moss is high in carrageenan and can be used as an effective thickener.","1270089559"

Everything from the sun, to the tides, and the movements of the moon were attributed to beings greater than ourselves.

However, as we have observed our world over generations, and learned more and more about the universe we live in, we have found rational explanation for all but the most obscure physical forces. As the realm of the unexplained shrinks, so do the gaps in which deities can hide.

The truth is, the gods of the ancient Hebrews, that survive today through constant reinvention and revisionism, serve no more rational an explanation as to the nature of life, morality or the universe, than the pantheons of the ancient Greeks, Aztecs, or New Guineans do. 

How Christians can see the absurdity of these forgotten deities, yet not cast that same filter of rationality toward Yahweh, Jesus and Satan that they do towards Zeus, Heracles, and Hades must require a tremendous degree of cognitive dissonance.

Morality, life, and the universe are observably much more ancient and primal than the world's major religions are obligated to claim, to preserve the divinity of their  scriptures. Having said that, the writings of bronze age theologists were wise for their era, and we can forgive them for concluding that their local folklore was the most reasonable explanation for their small, flat world. 

Today we have the capability to see further than these scribes could, and in the words of Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, ""I don't see any God up here.""","1270089672"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Just to be clear--- ""psychopathy"" and ""sociopathy"" are non-medical terms used interchangeably in common parlance. They refer to extremes on the continuum represented by Antisocial Personality Disorder, and there is not common agreement about calling those extremes anything. However, there IS research on the contributing causal factors to extremely anti-social behavior. While there are frequently biological factors, NO expert in the field of psychopathology (which is the study of the origins, characteristics and treatment of ALL mental illnesses) would EVER state categorically that extreme antisocial behavior (often called ""sociopathic,"" ie Jeffrey Dahmer) is ONLY biologically determined. It's so highly unlikely given everything we know about every other type of human behavior or human illness, that no reputable scientist would even bother trying to prove it.

And, YES, childhood experiences, including parenting, are HIGHLY implicated in extreme antisocial behavior. To state this fact is NOT equivalent to ""blaming"" parents. The complexity of the parent-child relationship and its impact on the child, ESPECIALLY in early childhood, is such that it renders meaningless statements like ""perfectly fucked up kids come from completely normal families."" It's NOT that simple just as it is not as simple as saying that ""child is fucked up therefore parents at fault.""

"Python","t5_2qh0y","Most Python web frameworks are fairly independent of each other. There are a few (TurboGears, Pylons) that take several independent packages and combine them together. Where as say Django has all custom parts.

All web frameworks have to sit on a web server. Most frameworks include their own, but most frameworks can use most servers thanks to WSGI.

There are also micro-frameworks which don't have all of the features of most frameworks, but are nice for simple projects.

When doing web development with Python it has been my experience that you will need to use or create your own framework for any non-trivial website (in this case trivial means ""Hello World"").

I don't know how familiar you are will all of the parts of a ""full stack"" so I'll toss out a few examples.

Your average full stack framework might have a web server for handling the requests, a routing system for calling the proper function or page depending on the url, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for abstracting the database, and a template system for putting the data into the HTML. Generally speaking when you choose a full stack framework you do so because the framework does much of the work of joining those parts together.

"NexusOne","t5_2re99","I bought mine on impulse, too. I've had it for about a month now, and I have no regrets. Prior to the Nexus One, I used an iPod Touch. While the iPod/iPhone interface is certainly nice and simple, the Android interface is more functional. It took me a little getting used to, though.

Apps on the Nexus One are blazing fast. There are some great apps out there, and there are some really horrible apps. This is true of the App Store, too, though. If you pay for an app and you don't like it, you can get a refund if you uninstall it within 24 hours.

The screen is awesome. It sucks in the sunlight, but I've never really had a device that was easy to read in direct sunlight. I just set the brightness to max when I'm having problems with it, and that tends to fix the problem.

Battery life sucks. It seemed the worst the first few days, probably because I was using it non-stop. The spare battery is probably a good investment, however.

Typing is another weak point. The keyboard just doesn't seem to have the accuracy of the iPod/iPhone. Luckily, the OS is open enough that a clever 3rd-party can make alternate input methods, like Swype. 

GPS works well - I've used Google's turn-by-turn navigation a few times with less trouble than I've had with standalone GPS units.

The camera puts out decent enough pictures.

As an MP3 player, the default music player is a bit cumbersome. Certainly not as refined as the iPod functionality on the iPhone. 3rd party apps may provide a better experience, I haven't messed with it much.

The phone functionality is definitely better than the iPhone.

Voice Search/Voice Input is pretty handy, and it actually works decently.

If you ever get around to rooting your phone, it's a pretty simple task. I did it, but there really is no compelling reason at this time to do so unless you're the type that likes to do that sort of thing.

All in all, it's a great smartphone, one of the best out there.

I'm not sure if you're Indian or not, but I am. And I can tell you that we are not at the ""top of the list"" compared to white people. We have to overcompensate for our low muscle tone, skinny frames, etc. by working out, eating healthy, dressing well, wearing cologne, having a respectable job. 

You can't do much about having a respectable job (i.e. doctor, dentist, lawyer, etc.), until you become one, but women are attracted to men who have potential and are headed somewhere. 

You have to be someone. And have a genuine mindset of success in life. 

Your life first, then women. 

If you can never take control of your own person life, you are doomed to a life of second/third classness and we all know that girls all flock towards the alpha males, fuck them, and then settle with some good reliable providers. 

You have a lot of weak points, it's good that you're realizing them, and you're making steps --- but hurry it up. Otherwise you can have all teh game in the world, but if you don't appear normal or ABOVE normal, all the ""game strategy"" in the world will mean shit. 

Also shave too/groom yourself if need be. 

Exercise. Dress well/dress sharp EVERYDAY (NICE SHOES, NICE PANTS, NICE SHIRT, doesn't have to be a tie, but NICE) = $1000-1300. Might want to get into shape first/lose pounds/tighten your muscles up before splurging on that, but shoes, and some things to tide you over will help.

Remember, we're in America, the most superficial ADD/ADHD girls are here, they ARE superficial, so give them what they want --- you don't want to marry them afterall. 

**tl;dr --- you won't believe how INCREDIBLY superficial people are and how NAIVE they are. You know everything that can possibly go wrong? It WILL HAPPEN TO YOU. You seem to have a good idea of what will probably happen and why, so you need to address those points. **

Now sell **the computer**, get the fuck off the internet, read your seduction books if necessary for review (stick to 2-3 at the most, don't overcomplicate it --- game is not that complicated), before you go to bars drink to get a little above tipsy so that you talk to anyone, and try to find a group of guys/girls to go to the bars with. This will all get you going. Being a loner however will seriously hold you back, and is going to cripple you until you meet up with a group of people who are cool. Might want to work on that factor yourself too (learn sports talks even if you hate the shit, have some parties, smoke weed with the potheads on occasion, TALK ABOUT THE OTHER PEOPLE, BEFRIEND MEN SO THEY INVITE YOU, ETC. ETC.).

If you need to get new information or ask for help, use it at the library or somewhere else. Your biggest problem is the computer.

"math","t5_2qh0n","I read his list of topics at each of the stages and not his books.

I'd suggest:  Start at your destination point on the horizon and, for how to get there, work backwards.  As part of that, pick a university with a math department like you want, for undergrad and then grad.  Then see what THEY want, including course topics and texts.  

E.g., for undergrad, will likely want to do well on the math knowledge GRE.  I got 800, but that test went to 1000, and I could have done better.  To do well on that test, see what is recommended as preparation for it.  Doing well on that test should be one of the best ways to get a warm reception in the graduate program of your choice.

Also, do not be misled:  ASAP you need to f'get about **learning** math and concentrate, instead, on **creating** math.  Or, no one can carry the QA section of the library around in their heads, and in a good research oriented department no one will want you to or respect you for it.  After you pass the qualifying exams showing you can learn enough math, commonly no one will care what you know, but they will care very much what you can create.  Then the secret to success, for your status in the department, your Ph.D., your first academic job, and the start of your academic career, is to **publish** some nice things.  I never wanted an academic career, but I did publish two nice papers, and they did wonders for me in academics.  One of these I did in two weeks as a grad student; any of my profs would have loved to have done that work; that work made the rest of my time to my Ph.D. easy, I could do no wrong.  

Actually, what it takes to do well in the harder exercises in the better early grad texts really **is** good training for part of what it takes to do research.  Research can be fun because you get to do any darned thing you want that is *new, correct, and significant*; that is, you are not forced to solve a problem posed by someone else and, instead, get to pick the problem you will solve, the theorems you will state and prove, etc.

The first key to good research is good problem selection.  I think that the next key is a good intuitive view of the problem and what might be relevant to it.  Intuition is crucial because it is how you guess what might be true.  Also, for your guesses, mostly you test those just intuitively.  By the time you get to a significant theorem, you pretty well know it's true and about how to prove it.

Here's another big secret:  Pick an applied problem from outside pure math.  Then get a math solution to this problem, hopefully with a least a little new math, that is good.  Then your math can be seen as *significant* because it solves the real problem!  Also the real problem is ground not thoroughly plowed by others so is likely a place you can get results easily.  

Another trick:  Want an Ivy League degree?  F'get about your ability to get accepted in undergrad as more than just luck unless your family can donate, say, $100 million.  But in grad school, you have a good chance of getting in!  It's still an Ivy League degree, even if it's just a Ph.D.!

Another trick:  For graduate school, go to the best university you can get into.  The lesser schools are insecure about how much they are asking from you so will ask more, sometimes **much** more.  Some of the lesser schools can drag you through some brain-killing five years of courses before research and then be both too narrow and too weak on *directing* your research.  Actually, I suggest you just find your own research problem, e.g., on an applied problem from outside your math department, see your way to a solution, maybe write 50 pages, and, when you are fairly sure you can do the rest, **then** propose it as your problem.  Whether they approve your problem or not, finish it and **publish** the work.  At the better schools, you will be essentially done because their main requirement for a Ph.D. is just ""an original contribution to knowledge worthy of publication"" or some such, and you will already have **published** it.  Let the journal editors decide if the work is *new, correct, and significant* and avoid arguing with your profs, **especially** at a lesser school.  

One more, read the A. Wiles description of how he regards math research as finding his way in a dark room until he finds the light switch.","1270089851"

Because they don't think it looks ridiculous. Which means that whether or not it looks ridiculous is not a universal absolute, it's a part of your mental model of the world.

Which means your mental model of the world is arbitrarily restricting you from thinking some kinds of thoughts. It's a bug, a flaw, a problem to be corrected.

You didn't choose to find them ridiculous, you never sat down and decided which groups of people to laugh at next, stop crowing about it as if it's some kind of justified sign of a high IQ and see it for the broken bit of brain it is.

You don't get free run on hating people just because you happen to hate them through no choice of your own. Wearing spray tan is no more absoutely ridiculous than having whatever haircut you have or wearing whatever clothes you wear.

It is different to hating black people, who did not choose their skin colour, but it's no different to hating 'rag-heads' who did not choose the headgear their parents and religious leaders taught them to wear, or 'sand niggers' who didn't choose the country they were born in, or 'beaners' who didn't choose their country's reputation for eating beans, even if all those behaviours are changeable.","1270089871"

I never liked RPGs at all and I found Disgaea 2 to be extremely fun... I put about 130 hours into it, which is *a lot* for me. Every told me it's a ""hardcore JRPG"" or something like that... bullshit, it's just a RPG that isn't boring as shit. There's grinding, but for the first 100 hours you don't need to grind very much. I put about 130 hours into it before it got to the point that I'd have to grind a ton to get significantly further.

I recommend it. Very fun game. My only complaint (I guess as a non-JRPG guy?) is that the high level special attacks got to the point where they were painful to watch. 15-20 seconds per fucking attack, my God. I felt that it killed the pacing of the game.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","It seems fair to say that the 1999 platform is the last official statement.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud#Palestinian_policy

Netanyahu's conditions (*not* official Likud plaform)  are ""he state being demilitarized, without an army or control of their airspace"".  This is not, I think, ""clearly two states"" per your original claim.

There seems to be no formal repudiation of the 1999 platform, in the way that there has been a formal recognition by Fatah of Israel.  The 1999 platform is still the one quoted by most pro-Israel sites, like jewishvirtuallibrary.   Both Kadima and Labor, on the other hand, do have such statements in their [platforms](http://www.israelvotes.com/platforms.php); Likud, the ruling coalition leader, does not.

Unlike you, Israel's biggest paper interpreted their 1999 platform as still the latest word as of 2008; I'd expect them to know of anything more recent.  [Theisraelproject.org](http://www.theisraelproject.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=hsJPK0PIJpH&amp;b=689705&amp;ct=6707351), apparently a clearinghouse of information on Israeli elections, also cites the 1999 platform as the last authoritative source.

Aside from the fact that users can upload photos to the ""website [which] will build up a ’mosaic’ of Australia"", which is comparable to photos+Google Maps, and who-knows-how-many-other-sites, I think it would be very likely the similarities would end there.

I'm not personally advocating that alcohol or cars be banned, just trying to draw parallels, because the Govt tries to stop people drinking too much, because it's bad for you.

If the issue is that the Govt should not try to stop us doing things that are bad for us, then we should have an uproar about the pictures on tobacco products -- but we don't.  I've taken the headline at face value and have tried to make an honest answer to the question posed.

As for your last comment, it buys votes from people who, even if they think it won't be effective, they still appreciate that the Govt recognises that this is a vector for harm and that harm minimisation is appropriate, even if this is the wrong approach.

The thing is for a heavy smoker, the day after he quits, he may experience some 'withdrawal' like effects, but they're not going to be anything serious, because his body will still have THC coursing through his body. 

If you're a heavy smoker who begins a period of abstinence, you're still going to have THC in your body, although usually not at levels that make you feel 'high.' If you exercise, which I agree is a great idea, you will burn fat that has THC stored, so you might get euphoric or light-headed at times.

It all depends on one's metabolism, how quickly they flush THC, how much fat they have, and how tolerant they are/how much THC they need to get high. ","1270089964"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Objective C inherits with C all its problems. It adds lousy memory management. Cocoa then adds a brain-dead single-threaded architecture.

Sure there are Objective-C classes for pretty much everything in Darwin plus all the core Apple libraries - but they are just an OO-layer on top of the C implementation of the algorithms and data structures. Pixel-level manipulation and the whole core graphics engine is written in C - called Core Graphics.

'The Core Graphics framework is a **C-based** API that is based on the Quartz advanced drawing engine. It provides low-level, lightweight 2D rendering with unmatched output fidelity. You use this framework to handle path-based drawing, transformations, color management, offscreen rendering, patterns, gradients and shadings, image data management, image creation, masking, and PDF document creation, display, and parsing.'

Smalltalk 80 is so mindblowing that you forgot that lots of its concepts came from languages like Simula (classes, dynamic dispatch, ...), Lisp and others.

I'm not really excited by nested classes, not really. Predicate Dispatch also does not make me jealous. These are all tools. If my application doesn't use them, they are all useless.

ML is antiquated. True. 

Agora and Obliq: 'extensive research projects'? The Agora home page lists 6 (six) papers. Obliq has probably less papers. That's not 'extensive'.

I guess not a single application written in these languages is in use.

&gt; Smalltalk had a MOP for as long as it's had meta-classes

For a different purpose. In Smalltalk every class definition created a meta class. In CLOS the whole OO mechanisms are exposed an OO way and specified as such - on the language level, not as an implementation. Thus one can write meta-classes and specify the meta class for a class - or for functions, methods, slot descriptors, ... With CLOS the MOP became a part of the language, not an implementation detail.

No, it's not helpful at all because it's another one of your non-sequiturs. **You say it yourself:**

&gt; Today, it's safe to say this is arbitrary

**The standard is arbitrary.** It was based on some technical limit at the time, and as soon as technology progressed, that technical limit (and accordingly, that standard) *changed*. Now that we've got sensors that produce higher-resolution than film, the standard *changes*. Or heck, I could have used a very high ISO, low-density grain film back in the day, and that would have changed the standard too.

So if your standard viewing distance is arbitrary and can be defined to be anything, like I've said all along, your ""normal"" lens is equally arbitrary. If I took a 12MP image, you would have to stand *closer* to the image than say a 6MP image, to get your ""eye resolution = image resolution"" metric. Thus if you're basing your definition of a normal lens on the standard viewing distance, you're saying that on a 12MP camera the normal lens will be different from a 6MP camera.

And by now I guess you've completely abandoned this, but have you noticed that your argument about standard viewing distance is completely based on resolution? I thought your original idea was that a normal lens had a certain perspective? Or magnification? Or something like that?","1270090120"

"math","t5_2qh0n","I like Sage's documentation. It has a good tutorial. And the one written by Paul Lutus (lutusp on Reddit) is also good, though I think it might be a bit dated in places. And it has the advantage of being based on Python, which is **extensively** documented, as it's a very popular language. But before you look up how to do something in Python, make sure it isn't implemented in Sage first! Example: primes(100) returns a 'generator.' You can do ""for x in primes(100):"" which will iterate over all prime numbers less than 100, for example. And list(primes(100)) returns a list [2,3,5,7,11,...] containing all primes &lt;100. 

Although I haven't tried doing *all* the basic undergrad stuff, the stuff I've tried works really well. diff(sin(x),x) returns cos(x), stuff like that. Matrix operations are nice. In places you have to learn some Python to know what's up--simple things like the fact that {1:2,3:4} is how a dictionary is written--but you'll also go through that learning Maple and Mathematica. Again, Python's well documented so you have an advantage here.

Sage definitely wins on price and if you already know Python it wins on ease of use too. Even if you don't, Python is a better-designed language (in terms of syntax, ease of learning, ease of use, etc) than Maple... not sure about Mathematica, since I haven't used it much.","1270090206"

I like to talk to others about Huxley as well.  I have gotten those looks, too.  I haven't read any of his essays yet.  I have tried, but I have a short attention span when it comes to philosophical-type topics.  

I think that BNW was/is so important to me is because I read it shortly after leaving a very strict, religious, cult-like upbringing (Jehovah's Witness).  Things like the *64,000 repetitions makes one truth* statement that Bernard made really hit home (I can't remember if that is the exact number).  I can also see a lot of other parallels between BNW, our society now, and the logical progression of our society (if we were to use that book as the source of logic).

Drink some booze before going to the clubs/bars to socially lubricate yourself (don't get addicted, just observe how easy it is for you to talk to people when you'er tipsy enough), and learn how to dance not like a retard. 

And go with some friends if you have any where you live. Work on your social network as well. 

Gaming is not as complex and strategical at the beginning as it needs to be. There are some few major pointers you can get from it all (more the ideology), but any meaningful tips you can get from that stuff won't be useful until you have basic convo, small talk, etc. down.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Actually they will continue supporting WoW and eventually they will make a whole new version of WoW, so why would they make a new MMO that is a lot like WoW. Most likely, it will be VERY different from WoW. They have 2 more expansions planned for WoW, why start cannibalizing their customer base. 

Also, you don't have to pay for maps in Starcraft 2. They have said this repeatedly. The store is for purchasing mods. They even said at blizzcon that the most popular mod for Warcraft 3 (Dota) would not have even qualified for being placed on the marketplace for a price because it wasn't a big enough departure from the original game. So essentially they are encouraging a thriving mod community by doing the valve strategy of lettings successful mod makers sell their modifications. They won't let just anyone release a mod and sell it, though. Custom maps will not be sellable.

In response to (5) the terran campaign is around 30 hours long. All the campaigns are going to be extremely long like that.

In response to (2), fans of that particular game are chomping at the bit for an expansion. If they didn't keep making expansions they would be letting their fans down big time.

In response to (3), your loss. MMO games can be extremely fun.

In response to (1), they were working on several games during that span. However, with the loss of Bill Roper and some Blizzard North staff games were delayed.

The GOP was never a prohibitionist party until the hippies threatened their values. The drug war is a war against people, and they will never end it while drug use represents cultural values.

The key to GOP support is promoting the perception of drugs as culturally-neutral tools. There is hope for doing that with weed, and even psychedelics now that there is medical research into their benefits.","1270090273"

"politics","t5_2cneq","The problem is that the phrase ""Constitutional"" is, in itself, ambiguous. The Constitution is pretty vague about a lot of things, either because the Founding Fathers disagreed about them (like slavery, which is why the Constitution says it just won't be discussed before a certain date, or the powers of the SCOTUS, which is why Article III is so short), or because they couldn't foresee all of the possible ramifications of everything in it.

The SCOTUS itself is only generally consistent under the same justices. In John Marshall's court (1801-1835), the SCOTUS generally used a very broad reading of the Constitution to uphold the power of the Federal government over states and its own power to interpret the Constitution. Judicial Review of Constitutionality is, in itself, a creation of the Marshall court, as it isn't anywhere in the Constitution. Under Roger Taney (1836-1864), the SCOTUS went in the opposite direction, and generally upheld States' rights through rigid interpretations of things like the Commerce Clause. The main problem with this form of interpretation (""originalism"") was that it didn't allow the Constitution any leeway to adapt to the issues of the time. Originalist interpretation is the reason why the Taney court decided [Dredd Scott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford) the way it did, as Taney argued that the original intent of the Founding Fathers was not to consider blacks as human beings.

From there, it only gets more inconsistent. In the late 18th/early 19th century, the SCOTUS consistently struck down business regulations as unconstitutional. This only really turned around when FDR appointed a bunch of new judges, and suddenly the Commerce Clause became the justification for just about any form of government control of business.

In general, the SCOTUS tends to just follow the political atmosphere of the times in its interpretations of the Constitution. There's almost nothing regarding the rights of the individual or the powers of State and Federal governments which hasn't been upheld from multiple angles in completely contradictory ways over the Court's history, because the Constitution itself is constantly being reinterpreted.

Basically, any time anyone tries to tell you that the Constitution is clear about any of this stuff, you should laugh in their face.","1270090276"

"reddit.com","t5_6","There is a difference in what was described and what the title describes. The definition of rape (date or not) is pretty simple: being forced to have sex against your will.

What the article describes is not that. It's an attempt to renegotiate on a past deed: get drunk, agree to sex, wake up the next morning, regret your actions and call it rape.

To be absolutely, crystal clear, the first IS NOT OK. The second IS NOT OK, EITHER.

It's your body, you are responsible for what you do with it. If you say ""yes"" and don't change your mind until hours after the deed is done, that's your fault. If you are not in the proper state of mind to make a decision like that, you should say ""no"", or avoid those types of situations.

The same goes the other way around. I don't care if she's parading around naked talking about how much she loves to have sex, if she says ""no"", that means you STOP.

From the male perspective, retroactive date-rape claims (assuming that it wasn't really rape to begin with) are particularly toxic. It means that men have to always assume that ""no"" means ""no"", and ""yes"" ALWAYS means ""no"", too. So, if you are saying that retroactive claims are ok, you should be aware that the impact of what you are effectively advocating for is that sex without a legally binding contract should be made illegal.

&gt; where everything is permissible for personal benefit (take whatever you want, whenever you want it), and altruism is only undertaken when there is a significant personal payoff.

Not quite.  There is a good amount of restriction in there as well, nor is there a requirement for particular amounts of personal payoff, nor any real requirement on what constitutes a payoff.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism#The_Eleven_Satanic_Rules_of_the_Earth is an interesting reference

Paraphrasing: Respect people in their homes, don't hurt kids, don't kill anything unless you're defending yourself or are going to eat it.  Don't whine.  Ban against sexual assaults.  Don't intrude on others lives.

Even one of the more interesting rules calls for restraint, even when other rules speak of acting cruelly: ""When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask them to stop. If they do not stop, destroy them.""

You might also notice among the ""9 sins"" is ""lack of perspective""... which flies largely in the face of a pure ""everything is permissible for personal benefit"", at least not if taken thoughtfully.  (and the #1 sin is being stupid)

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; I'm not really sure why we're all having this conversation when so many people here are determined to believe in their own interpretation.

simple answer, girls of reddit say action/line 'X' worked for some guy. guy of reddit has tried that (or something similar), and it didn't work. therefore guys of reddit conclude it's because they where deemed unattractive and branded as creepy. that's why people are bitching on both side, and no one is getting anything from this thread.

as for the shallowness, all human are shallow. we as humans are not above the same vanity that runs though life, in all species where there is female mate selection, females choose mates due to superficial means (peacocks are a great example of this, so are most birds and fish, some insects). in any species where there is alpha male selection, the male selects females due to fitness (examples include most primate). we are currently cough between both types, this leaves us with: men that want to find a women that will give the most reproductively successful offspring, with the highest likely hood of successful child birth. and women that are cough between 2 types of selection, thus looking for 2 completely different sets of traits: power and confidence from alpha male selection, and the superficial apple that sets one man apart from the other (this being a byproduct of female mate selection).

this leads to: men being frustrated and unhappy when they are rejected, while they are in a situation of control (ie, initiating contact with a women, and being turned down). and women who seemingly have varying ideas, and general uncertainty about the defining characteristics that make a male attractive.

yes, we are all indeed shallow, i just don't know why women conciser it so much more offensive than men.","1270090429"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I got two of 'em.

First one: I was born-and-raised in Upstate New York.  When I was nine, my Dad, Mr. Wilderness Photographer, took us across the country for a week-long, 50-mile hike through utter wilderness in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California.  The hike culminated in an ascent to the summit of Mt. Whitney, the highest point in the continental United States.  At the summit, there was a log book to sign, and a few lines above his own signature Dad noticed a name he recognized.  A few inquiries among other parties still in the area located the guy.  Dad had corresponded with him by mail for thirty years but had never met him until that day at the top of Mt. Whitney.  Dad had a LOT of stories like that.

Second one happened to me about eight weeks ago.  Backstory is that my (deep breath) wife's brother-in-law's brother's ex-wife, Karen, is a part-time hairdresser that my wife, her mother, and other sister and I had been going to.  Karen also worked at one of our local Holiday Inns.  Around September, Karen sort of ""disappeared"" and no one could reach her or knew what happened to her.  In January I ran into an old high-school girlfriend (from 1981) and in conversation found that her eldest daughter Sara, works at the same Holiday Inn.  I asked, ""Does Sara know anything about 'Karen?'""  Girlfriend replied, ""You mean Karen ____???  OMG, Sara is marrying Karen's son in August!""   Guess we know what's been keeping Karen busy.

(Oh, all right.  One more Dad story.  On a work travel assignment to the Grand Canyon, Dad was driving his team's rented RV when they came up on another RV.  Dad noticed, emblazoned on the back of it, the name of the small Pennsylvania town next to the one where he'd grown up.  Had the guy in the shotgun seat hold up a sign with HIS town's name on it, and both RVs pulled over to get acquainted.  A little conversation revealed that the lady in the other RV had worked with my Grandma (Dad's mother) at a laundry forty years previously.)

**tl;dr:** Dad corresponded with to a guy 30 years w/o meeting, then happened to run into him at the summit of Mt. Whitney.  My wife's brother-in-law's brother's ex-wife's son is marrying the daughter of one of my ex-girlfriends.  On a work trip Dad met a lady that worked with his mother forty years earlier.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;Well because unlike public employees who are paid by taxes, people privately employed are more or less paid according to supply and demand.

I have no idea why you are being down-voted here? 

I know of many states that are essentially in fiscal bankruptcy because of excessive payouts to the public employee sector. When a firefighter, police officer or other needed essential service can retire with $200,000 per year pensions with full benefits, yeah there are big problems, especially when known motives for working for the states is the inspiration of the golden retirement benefits...

Plenty of public workers, have done real well creating their own version of supply and demand, even when there was no demand. In one state, the law for public employees was this: Work for the state for at least one year, and you cannot get fired. 

I will not mention which state, but it is a known fraud based practice to be moved into a higher paying job one year prior to retirement, in order to double the pension plans... even if the person is not qualified for such a position, or actually performing an actual function.

When this questionable practice was publicly brought into the light, the state workers union basically said to the tax payers, ""We run the state, what are you going to do about it...?"" ","1270090505"

2.) Features are removed from upgrades *constantly*. Look at Visual Basic or SQL Server - there's functions in both that have been dropped due to security concerns or just becuase newer functions/pathways broke the old functions. If it broke your process, you know what the answer is? Don't upgrade. There's not too many Windows 3.1 programs that work natively on Windows 7 - things change over time.

It's because the United States is over. Eisenhower warned you. And you've sleepwalked in to this current nightmare.

OBviously don't work if you're in college, as grades mean much more, but save that money over summers and invest in yourself for a good daily wardrobe (week to two weeks supply is good, with a few ""night out"" shirts and nice jacket, and nice leather shoes, nice cologne) should cost you from $1000-$2000. $1000 is the bare minimum for that, but $1800ish is a fare number. Also iron your clothes. You don't need to buy it all at once, and you can build it up as time goes by, and you may want to delay getting clothes until your body is in better condition.

I also think it is a good next step in automotive control. I believe that the 'weakest link' in nearly any car is the driver, and anything that helps to reduce their ability to screw up while behind the wheel is a good step forward.

From a purely safety perspective, I think that the safest car is a car that can automatically take directions and drive you to your destination without you having to do any of the actual driving (steering, accelerating, brakes etc). It would probably also be the most boring to be in, but with the right mix of technologies could be significantly safer.

And would mean I didn't have to deal with idiots talking on the phone while driving, or not concentrating on the road while chatting to their passenger, or trying to read a map while driving etc.

Best of luck with that. It's okay to feel good about your personality, but feeling okay with being overweight or fat isn't constructive.

So what's in the middle? There's clearly a point moving from the left where one might say ""I don't know there is a god"" but can not say ""I know there are no gods"". Similarly moving from the right there is a point where one might say ""I don't know there are no gods"" but can not say ""I know there is a god"". 

These two positions are neither atheist nor theist. There is a middle ground. 

Under this consideration the differentiation of the middle is the act of [certainly] knowing. Hence a-gnostic. If you say ""I don't know [for certain] there are no gods"" or ""I don't know [for certain] there is a god"" then you are agnostic and are not theist nor atheist. If you assume either an atheistic or theistic position but are agnostic, that is fine but you're an agnostic.

Atheists appear to be attempting to appropriate the middle ground for themselves under a presumption of lack of theism for all who claim agnosticism. This is an application of the petitio principii fallacy. An agnostic is **logically** no closer to one position than the other. If you're an agnostic that has a leaning, based as you admit on lack of knowledge and hence not a logical position, that is fine.","1270090631"

Really? Okay then. In this case regarding childbirth extraordinary would be the measures taken rarely compared to other births.

I'm somewhat at a loss that it needed explaining.

&gt;Are you basing your definition of extraordinary on current technology, 1950's technology or 2050's technology?

Are we in 1950 or 2050? And regardless if a 1950s tech is rarely used but can do the job if needed then it would be extra ordinary by definition wouldn't it.

&gt;I think you are trying to get at some variant of ""survive on its own"" while avoiding the question of babies born with birth defects who need extraordinary/unnatural means to get them through their first months.

Birth defects aren't what we're discussing are they. If at 9 months a child is born without their heart valve fully closed, which isn't that uncommon actually, then the thing to do is repair it. That isn't even close to the same thing as a birth at 6 months in an otherwise normal development.","1270090673"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;Especially considering the preventative measures that are available. Birth control. An early abortion...

The question as you posed it makes no distinction between a pregnancy that's the result of unprotected sex or failed contraception, nor any direct distinction between an early or late abortion.  What is an ""early abortion""?  An abortion that occurs before life begins?  But the very question that started this was when life begins...

Because of the reasons I've outlined above, I think there's no distinction between early/late abortions, nor between pregnancies resulting from unprotected versus protected sex versus rape etc.  It doesn't mean I like abortion; and I think that late-term abortions are more tragic, I'd certainly counsel my daughter to seriously consider adoption as an alternative before late-term abortion.

But I don't think it's morally permissible for society to establish rules on when or under what circumstances the mother can or cannot abort.  Even if she decides to abort the baby a day before her due date for no reason other than she doesn't want to be pregnant for one more day.  To me, anything else establishes moral precedents that cannot be supported if extended to their logical conclusions.

As for the question of when life *does* begin?  I'm not sure that has an objective answer.  It's all about when you define life, and there seems to be no way to quantify one definition of life as better than another.  Can a person tell me why the ""viability"" threshold is a better definition of life than the ""fetal heartbeat"" threshold for instance?

If I were to pick a single definition, I'd pick ""detectable brain activity,"" only because it's the most convenient to quantify and corresponds to what we understand as the minimal needs for consciousness to exist, but I certainly can't give any reason why that would be the most *moral* definition to pick.  And anyway I support the right to abortions even beyond that point.","1270090737"

This is Kierkegaard's point. A Kantian system of morality (which includes God but not as the basis for morality) does not leave room for faith or for the absurd because God may ask the individual to do something which cannot be universally justified. 

&gt;In summary, if the price of following God's will is to kill my child or commit genocide

God did not require Abraham to kill Issac. He himself provided the sacrifice which prefigures God the Father sending his own son to the cross. I believe the God is Love, but I hope to have the faith/courage to obey him even when his will does not seem logical or reasonable. ","1270090765"

""**Strictly speaking, all claims require exactly the same amount of evidence, it's just that most ""ordinary"" claims are already backed by extraordinary evidence that you don't think about.** When we say 'extraordinary claims', what we actually mean are claims that do not already have evidence supporting them, or sometimes claims that have extraordinary evidence against them. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence because they usually contradict claims that are backed by extraordinary evidence.""

However, how do you do that last 20% if you don't own another computer?  The answer is simple:  you're going to need both.  Yet they'll make each other seem redundant due to both covering a large set of tasks.

* ~1/4 to 1/2 cup white cooking wine

To prepare:
Thinly slice garlic cloves, chop onion, and rub down pork chops on both sized with salt+pepper (Don't overdo it with the salt, the condensed soup has plenty).

In a large pan, heat olive oil on medium, toss in the garlic.  Give it a minute or two, then place pork chops in the pan.  Cook on one side approx. 10 minutes on medium-high heat.  

Right before the 10 minutes have passed, put the butter in, as soon as it's all liquid flip your pork chops and then toss in the mushrooms and onion to saute.  Do this for about 5 minutes or so.  

By now your pork chops should be browned on both sides and there should be a lot of brown stuff sticking to the bottom of the pan.  They may not be all the way done yet, depending on thickness, although they probably are.  Regardless, Take the pork chops out of the pan and set them on a paper plate or something.  Take your white cooking wine, and I just eyeball it, but pour just enough to get all that flavor thats sticking to the bottom of the pan to bubble off.  Then toss in the your pork chops, dump the can of condensed cream of mushroom soup in. Make sure you coat the chops and spread it evenly around the pan, cover, and continue cooking on medium-low heat for another 15-20 minutes, flipping the pork chops once.

Serve it up on brown rice with a vegetable of your choice.   It's a good recipe, pretty easy to make, and all the ingredients are easily attainable and cheap.  

The key to making it come out great is to do the prep ahead of time, figure out ahead of time how long everything will take to cook and make sure that it's all done at the same time.  You don't want your brown rice to get cold while you're waiting for the pork chops or vice versa.  Make sure you have all your ducks in a row before you start and you'll do just fine, and she'll be impressed.  My family was.","1270090905"

"Python","t5_2qh0y","Web applications consist of multiple layers. At the lower layer you have the web server. All modern Python web frameworks talk to the web server using wsgi this makes the web server somewhat interchangeable. Django, Pylons, TG, CherryPy, web2py, web.py they all come with some pure python web server for development purposes. Which one it is complicated because of the versions. For example TG1 and web2py &lt;=1.76.5 used the same web server as cherrypy (wsgiserver) but TG2 uses the same as Pylons (I think) and web2py &gt;1.76.5 uses Rocket. 

Tornado is a non-blocking web server (i.e. it does not achieve concurrency by spawning threads, instead it does it by calling IO functions when the socket is ready) and this makes it fast when you have many small (computationally speaking) http requests. Because of its nature Tornado does not work out of the box with web frameworks not designed for it.

Above the web server layer you have the dispatching. The code that maps url paths into function calls. Each framework has its own and conventions at this level are what distinguishes most of the frameworks.

Above that there are libraries to deal with specific protocols, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) or Database Abstraction Layer (DAL), and template language. Here is where framework can be divided in two categories: glued and full stack. 

Pylons is a glued framework. It is designed in a very modular way so that you plugin almost any ORM (although everybody prefers SQLAlchemy) and almost any template language (Genshi is the most common). Components are designed to be loosely coupled. TG can be seen as a specialization of Pylons. Cherrypy is also a glued framework because it is easy to plug and play components.

Zope, Django, and web2py and full stack frameworks. You can still replace components but the standard components are designed to work together and you loose some functionality if you replace one. Zope comes with ZODB (an OOP database), Django has its own ORM and web2py has a DAL. Each of them has its own template language. 

I can speak for web2py as an example because I know it best. You can replace the built-in web server with cherrypy, Rocket, Paste, Apahe+mod_wsgi, cherokee+fscgi, etc. etc. You can replace the template language with Genshi, Jinja, Kid, etc. You can replace the DAL with SQLAlchemy. BUT. If you replace the template language or the DAL you loose some functionality in automatic form generation and processing. You loose it because that functionality can only exist with tightly coupled components and glued frameworks often do no have that kind of functionality for that very same reason.

Supporters of glued framework tend to emphasize the ability to reuse code such as your existing database models (because of the choice of ORM) and templates (because of the choice of template languages).

Supporters of full-stack frameworks tend to emphasize the portability of applications designed for the framework, since the framework is always the same for different installations.

A lot of the difference is in the eye of the beholder and in the philosophy of the app developer. Developers who want to get their hands dirty and be able to customize everything will choose a glued framework. Developers who expect a framework to do as much as possible for them without need to look under the hood, will choose a full-stack framework.","1270090914"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Sorry...but the advocation of murder, or eternal punishment for a finite transgression of disbelief in silly superstition is not egalitarianism. It is in fact totalitarianism at it's finest. God is everywhere always watching and judging, and if you don't do what god likes you'll rot in hell forever, even if your perfectly moral and never hurt anyone, simply not believing in Jesus is enough for eternal punishment. Saying that non-believers will die, and only good christians won't is not egalitarian. The last time I checked, there is no more merit to christianity then any other religion, and therefor any claim that your specific god gave me something is pointless. I did not ask to be born into slavery in service of a god that is so jealeous he needs constant worship, and complete ignorance coupled with blind faith. 

""If there be a god, he must more approve of the homage of reason, then that of blindfolded fear."" -Thomas Jefferson. 

Also, being able to do whatever you want, may be called free will, but again, you say that as if it is some gift from a specific god. The bible also frowns upon rich people, as Jesus said it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. If you are a true christian, surely you've given away your earthly possessions by now. We were given nothing to begin with, because we are biological creatures in the same cycle of life with every other species. We simply have evolved to be able to ask important questions, and predict outcomes. Religion is nothing more then a long list of things you can't do, for the weary, weak, and those afraid of death.

I would rather live a life based on doing the good thing for the sake of being a good person, then because I thought I would be rewarded for it with some ludacris notion of the afterlife. it is selfishness, and nothing more. If you would rather be comfortable rather then correct, that is your life, but don't try to impose your irrationality on others and expect to be taken seriously. ","1270090954"

"programming","t5_2fwo","""Just because lawyers are using misleading language and funny loop holes to hide what they are doing does not mean they are not patenting algorithms.""

It's not ""misleading language"" or ""funny loopholes."" It's a fundamentally different view of the invention.

Let me characterize your argument for you: A general-purpose computer, programmed in a particular way to solve a particular problem, is not a patentable invention. Would you agree with this statement?

Unfortunately, the courts have turned down this proposition time and time again. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to take this position in Diamond v. Diehr in 1981. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit refused to take this position in 2009. These are the two leading cases of today in this field, and both emphatically refuse to adopt the blanket rule above.

This position was most directly rejected in In re Alappat (Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, 1994.) Here's the relevant snippet:

""The proper inquiry in dealing with the so called mathematical subject matter exception to Section 101 alleged herein is to see whether the claimed subject matter as a whole is a disembodied mathematical concept, whether categorized as a mathematical formula, mathematical equation, mathematical algorithm, or the like, which in essence represents nothing more than a “law of nature,” “natural phenomenon,” or “abstract idea.” If so, Diehr precludes the patenting of that subject matter. That is not the case here.

""Although many, or arguably even all, of the means elements recited in claim 15 represent circuitry elements that perform mathematical calculations, which is essentially true of all digital electrical circuits, the claimed invention as a whole is directed to a combination of interrelated elements which combine to form a machine for converting discrete waveform data samples into anti-aliased pixel illumination intensity data to be displayed on a display means. This is not a disembodied mathematical concept which may be characterized as an “abstract idea,” but rather a specific machine to produce a useful, concrete, and tangible result.

""The fact that the four claimed means elements function to transform one set of data to another through what may be viewed as a series of mathematical calculations does not alone justify a holding that the claim as a whole is directed to nonstatutory subject matter. Indeed, claim 15 as written is not “so abstract and sweeping” that it would “wholly pre-empt” the use of any apparatus employing the combination of mathematical calculations recited therein. Rather, claim 15 is limited to the use of a particularly claimed combination of elements performing the particularly claimed combination of calculations to transform, i.e., rasterize, digitized waveforms (data) into anti-aliased, pixel illumination data to produce a smooth waveform.""

As far as why they differ from libertarians, I don't think they do.  I'm guessing if you talked to most of those people they'd believe in libertarian principles. I think that they believe in taking a more militant political stand on those principles, though. But I dunno, that might be giving them too much credit.

Grayson is normally great, but this was just ridiculous.  For someone who claims to be a major proponent of political dialog and an end to yelling matches, he sure shot himself in the foot on this one.

As far as the message of the tea party goes, I don't think the majority of tea partiers are actually advocating violence and hatred.  I think that their representation in the media is such that the signs you see and the videoclips on the internet you find are 98% of the crazy, fucking nutjobs that make up the 10% (okay, maybe 20%) of the movement itself.

The debate Grayson had with that tea partier that was on the frontpage the other day is not the only example of a somewhat (emphasis on that word) intelligent member of the tea party.

I don't see how you can say that Pinochet and Castro are even remotely similar.  Of course, they were both dictators with a lot of blood on their hands, but at least Pinochet has something to show for it (or at least didn't epically fuck up his country).

The curves, how they are perched, the perkiness.  Many factors matter.  If guys are checking your out over girls with bigger ones, then you should be thinking, ""I WIN!  Mine are better!  Multiple sources confirm this!""

Take Victoria Beckham for example, those boobs on that girl look like plastic add ons that will pop out at any time and take out an eye.  It's just wrong.

I also dated a rather attractive woman in the 90's who used to be married to Papa John of the pizza chain fame, and I quickly found out that her boobs were fake.  Not all fakes are bad, but I was rather disappointed.  For one, they didn't feel like they were part of a human, they felt like hard oranges under her skin or like squeezing a plastic car bumper.  They did not feel beautiful.  Also, her surgery had them placed in through the nipple and the scar tissue looked like she had smiley faces on each boob.  The visual image of lovely smooth female breasts was destroyed.

I guess the moral to this story is that there are many unknown factors that matter to guys about a woman's girls.  Just because they might be bigger doesn't mean they sit best on the woman who has them.

And Victoria Beckham?  She looks like like an alien with the stick figure arms and cantaloupe boobs.  ","1270091081"

Let me recap the general impression that people have: 

&gt; I will preface this by saying I'm a senior in college who hasn't really made any new friends in a long time.

Loner, not social.

&gt; I walk through the dining hall and eventually spot 2 girls, one standing one sitting. I sit down and say hi, and ask the sitting girl what makes her interesting. She says she just is. I've been trying to incorperate stories about interesting stuff in my life so I vaguely allude to some shit involving the police. 

Socially awkward. 

&gt;  I mentioned that I was trying to get out of my shell and they were my 10th group 

Gives the impression that you're a weirdo and pathetic to outsider. 

&gt; no status, no money, not fit, don't dress well

people/girls care about these things. 

&gt;  My aim at this point in my life is JUST to be able to enjoy and make enjoyable talking with girls.

Yes, but obviously you're failing on that end. Girls in our age group (I'm 22 btw) care about superficial shit. They will only see you as a creeper guy until you appear to be more refined/polished. 

5 years ago I was 150 pounds and no girl paid attention to me, now I'm 180 with solid muscle on me, I dress well to parties, and generally everywhere, look sharp, get a little tipsy before going to bars, and have an alpha male attitude, nice but cocky, and I get pussy and befriend people without a problem. 

&gt; dude you sound like a hardcore troll 

You obviously don't trust others, have major issues with people who try to help you and push others away it seems like. It sounds like you just want validation from others that you're doing ok, when in reality **you're not.**

But whatever, I'm done here, you can make the horse go to the water, but you can't make it drink it.

All I can say is go back to my original thread and look at the parts list.  There are links to everything I used, except that I ended up getting a small wood chisel to make the trench look more professional.

Look at the description of how the device works, and look at the diagram I posted showing dimensions. (look at this post specifically: http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/ayola/diy_launch_box_attempt_anybody_willing_to_shed/c0k5zk8)


Just use those parts, know that you need spade drill bits to bore the holes, and look at all the threads I posted.  It can be done.  Just messing with it for a few hours I made a very usable prototype, and have plenty of ideas for improvements

Just look at my parts list, study the retail one (i linked to plenty of pictures/descriptions/etc) and have at it.

I know its not what you are looking for, but my homework is pressing on me, so just give it a go.  The thread is the key.  Just get a drill, some spade bits, and the parts and give it a try.

Oh, and cutting those damn pipe fittings is the hardest part.  and bending them -- if you can, get someone at the hardware store to cut them to size, it will save a headache or two.  Also, to bend them drill a hole the size of the copper pipe into a piece of wood and then bend them, holding them securely.  Then you will know what size you need to drill from the battery area to the vaporizing area, so its a win win

And do stuff for yourself and the wife every so often. I think I am having the hardest time giving up my personal time. The only way I have been able to combat this so far is by making sure that I have an hour or two after they go to bed, and every couple of weeks I take an extended time away from the family and work, maybe 4-5 hours with friends or something.

The other thing I've noticed is that my daughter (she's the 2.5 one) has gotten considerably easier to deal with. Potty training her has been a dirty rotten bitch, but she is really starting to get more independent and is able to do more.

Tough it out. It gets better. Oh, one more thing, try to get some specific activities in with the kids. My daughter loves drawing with me. And my son is still at the age where I just have to make silly faces and he thinks I'm a comic god. 

And thanks for this post. I've been on the verge of a nervous breakdown for the last few days, but it's cathartic to write some of this out. It also helps to know that I am not the only guy that feels this way, because my wife doesn't feel like this at all.

Second, your characterization is not correct for US law. There are very few times when speech can be restricted, the only relevant ones here being fighting words or perhaps defamation. Neither of which apply, fist because there was no imminent danger and second because there were no (to my knowledge) particular claims about the people involved in the case (even then it would be a stretch due to the political nature of the protests).

Finally, this misses the point. The first amendment doesn't have anything to do with the actions of the father. The father can do whatever he wants to try to restrict the speech of WBC. The first amendment is only violated when the state sanctions those actions by means of the courts (or police, laws, etc.). It did that here by the trial court. 

This outcome is definitely constitutional, in spite of the repugnance of the outcome. And the father did nothing wrong, but he does have to bear the cost to the party against whom he filed the lawsuit. Finally, Bill-O is being a stand up guy in this situation.

(A)theism has to do with whether or not one believes any gods exist.

These concepts are orthogonal.

It is possible (and extremely common) to be an agnostic atheist -- one who thinks it is not possible to know whether any gods exist, while at the same time not holding a belief that any gods exist.

It is possible to be a gnostic atheist (someone who thinks it is possible to know if any gods exist, and who does not hold any beliefs that any gods exist.)

It is possible to be an agnostic theist, someone who thinks it is not possible to know if any gods exist, but who holds a belief that at least one god does exist.

It is possible (and very common) to be a gnostic theist, one who thinks it is possible to know if any gods exist, and one who holds a belief that at least one god exists.

Additionally, it is possible to be gnostic about certain particular concepts of god while agnostic about others.  For instance, one might be gnostic about the flying spaghetti monster, or Xenu concluding that it is possible to know that they are made up concepts -- we even know who made them up -- and so conclude that it is possible to know that they not real gods -- while at the same time you might be agnostic atheist about Loki -- since he's a trickster god who might conceivably delight in deluding you about his non-existence, and being a god, might be capable of doing so in a way undetectable to a mere mortal.

But at $42,000, the average teacher’s salary is not bad, particularly for a job with a three-month summer vacation. Still, the union's pleas for higher pay are not surprising. After all, unions exist in part to negotiate higher wages. But U.S. Department of Education data show teacher salaries have increased steadily over the past 20 years, while student achievement has steadily declined. This raises the question: If students are learning less, should teachers be getting paid more?

Under the status quo, teacher salaries bear little relation to student performance. For instance, at $48,304, the average teacher salary in Washington, D.C., tops 44 other states. Yet student achievement is among the worst in the nation. Such low achievement suggests there might be a few teachers in that lot who deserve no pay at all.

http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=4287

So exactly how does ANYONE expect to demand higher and higher pay while producing poorer and poorer results? Teachers must live in some kind of fantasy world, or maybe its this...

Teachers also feel that higher salaries and benefits would reflect a larger measure of public respect for their profession. Teachers' union officials often say that teachers should receive respect comparable to that afforded doctors, lawyers, accountants and other professionals. Indeed, Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers, has been quoted as saying that beginning teaches should earn wages comparable to those afforded beginning doctors and lawyers. 

http://www.calnews.com/Archives/1YB_II_sal.htm

Bingo, teachers have an ego fueled by unions who convince them they should get higher pay because they are TEACHERS, and have difficult jobs! Well cry me a river, don't we all. Its unfortunate that we all can't live in the fantasy world of your high school teacher. ","1270091258"

also interesting.  for background, i'm 30/M, but i perceive myself as being more emotionally reactive than males in my demographic.  in stressful situations, my fuse is short, and i'm known to flip into rant mode at the moment of stress, but, as of recently, i'm improving my behavior when i'm *not* in a stressful moment.  ""leaving it at the office"" as they say.  perhaps ranting during the moment allows me the freedom to do this.  what kind of latitude do you have at work to express frustration or anger?  

but the aforementioned example/scenario is merely a subset of scenarios that are stressful, and you desire a more general method of handling stressful situations than just ranting during the moment.  this seems like a very personal question, one which only you can answer.  

what thought patterns, behaviors, or activities do you like to engage in that lower your stress levels?  perhaps you like taking a stroll in a forest somewhere, getting a massage, slamming doors, thinking about puppies, or taking bats to large metal objects?  i think changing your thought patterns (embracing acceptance) is important, but i think activities could also facilitate lowering stress.

speaking from personal experience, however, changing your thought patterns doesn't occur overnight.  throughout my life, i've believed something cerebrally (ie, acceptance is good), but i actually didn't *feel* it, or live it.  i think my main cognitive error was that intellectually accepting a concept or specified thought pattern was the same thing as *living* it, but they're different.  there is a lag time between believing it to be true on an intellectual level, and actually living it.  does that make sense?

He was terrified of what he called the neck breaky stage.  Anyway it is hard to deal with all of it until your child is a bit older.  You are sleep deprived, sex deprived, and everything that you once loved about your life is now DEAD.  You basically after 3 or so years will learn to re-evaluate what you truly cared about in your life and keep what you can, what is practical and toss the rest.  My husband describes it as a 3 year prison sentence because when you get done everything has changed without you.  My Opinion, you will be ok, take it one day at a time and maybe try to give yourself a day or two out of the month to do something you used to love to do, Whatever that maybe.  Also find time to spend with your wife a couple times a month, Sans Baby it will make things not seem so bad.","1270091301"

He IS a father whose child was kidnapped by the government.  You'd think he'd be pretty upset.  The child ""dies"" in front of him, and he thinks about killing himself.   I just see that as realistic and honest instead of glossed over and trivialized like most games would do.  

He's supposed to just pick up and start randomly fighting like some video game badass should?  Seriously, what does he have to live for at that moment?  His wife is already dead.  He just lost his child.   People are trying to hunt him down and kill him.  He didn't have a ""cause"" as much as the others did, he just wanted his kid back.  For once the group wasn't some singularity of opinion and cause... his motivations were a little more complicated and subject to change.

The chocofro was just a reminder of his son and what he thought he had to live for.  It was cute and somewhat humorous.

the odds of any one of several mega volcano eruptions occurring in climate scale time are 100%.  what will that do to your climate model?  a next solar minimum or maximum could happen any year, but will happen in climate scale time.  inevitable chaos is not on your side.  your predictions will not come true, except by chance.  we're warming out of one ice age and eventually will enter another, with chaos intervening and making plenty of noise in the climate curve.

Chances are pretty damn good that his parents didn't dress like this, and his parents didn't raise him to dress like this, for cultural reasons.  Yet again, if you can't tell the difference between cultural traits and an idiot fad, that's your failing.  Name a nation where this is the norm, and where he's just dressing the way all his friends and relatives have for generations, and you'll have an argument there.  That's the difference between an idiot fad and an ingrained cultural trait. 

This guy wasn't born in a nation where this is the norm for men, so your comparison to arabs being called sand niggers because of their birthplace is faulty.   And hispanics that are called beaners don't make beans an all consuming lifestyle, like this guy did with his douchewear. And yet again, a person has no control over what is thought of his nation, not his fault.  This guy adopted a fashion not because of a national identity, but because he thinks it looks good.


Reddit makes fun of people who have a choice in the way they look.  They've hit these idiots, tattoo fanatics, goths, fat people, insane body builders.  All people who have done things to themselves not dictated by their nation or upbringing.   Reddit is not being hypocritical about this.   Now the argument of whether these people should be ridiculed for what they've done to themselves is a different one.  

A quick recap.  You've compared looking like this to
&gt;Ill treatment of animals! 

animal abuse
&gt;check this article about some horrible racism

being of a certain race
&gt;Kick goths off a bus!

the refusal of service to someone just because they're weird looking
&gt;it's no different to hating 'rag-heads' who did not choose the headgear their parents and religious leaders taught them to wear

Islamic culture
&gt;'sand niggers' who didn't choose the country they were born in

being of Arab decent
&gt;'beaners' who didn't choose their country's reputation for eating beans, even if all those behaviours are changeable

and the derogatory terms people use for those from certain nations.


These things are not like an idiot who decides to look like this.  You have suggested they are by saying reddit is hypocritical for attacking this guy, but being outraged about the rest.  That's not correct, even if you'd like to believe it is.   

I can see what you really wanted to do here was display how self righteous and enlightened you think you are.  Unfortunately you've exposed your lack of understanding of the difference between culture and what this guy has done to himself.   What you've done is take the idea of cultural relativity and ran with it, applying it in places that is doesn't fit.

If you can't figure this out yourself, try unpopping your collar, it might be blocking the flow of blood to the brain.

Frankly I'd be in that position myself -- not that I'm positive I'm ready to be in another relationship either, but if he understands where his feelings are coming from and he's not holding it against you, you might just need to be patient. If he's worth the time, just wait for him to come around.

KNoppix is another great alternative to boot from and run diskchecks. I hope you werent trying to use ryerserfs or btfs or something like that for a desktop install, it would provide you no benefits.

But your argument is also what i'm against. When you play an RPG, you can't expect to know what you're in for within the first 5 hours, or even the first 10. They progress as your powers build. Final Fantasy XIII is a lot more linear than the other games, but it's not just ""mash x, run, mash x"" as most people imply. In the first 5 hours? Yes, it is.

You are likely at or near the ""bottom"" find your quiet and begin thinking through your actions. Begin by observing others and trying to understand why they do what they do.

Every time you lifted your arms, your bra would roll up under your arms? It's the same thing for women with a bilateral mastectomy. There is nothing to keep the bra in place. 

These may be helpful for women with a single mastectomy, but they are not much help for the rest of us.

Instead I urge you to support efforts at funding reconstruction. Yes, I know the law. Any insurer who covers a mastectomy, must also pay for reconstruction. Except very few plastic surgeons accept Medicaid. The new health care bill does nothing to address this problem.

There are thousands of breast cancer survivors each year who are treated with a disfiguring lumpectomy or mastectomy who have no hope of reconstruction because very few plastic surgeons who do breast reconstruction accept Medicaid. Those that do have years long waiting lists.

There is one charity in the entire US, [MyHopeChest.org](http://www.myhopechest.org/), who pays for reconstruction. This issue has been ignored by the breast cancer standard bearers like ACS, Susan Komen, Dr. Love and BC Research Fund. Reconstruction is not a simple in and out procedure like augmentation. It involves multiple surgeries with much longer recovery times.

So people need to just get over it and accept that there will be government and taxes and try to find the right balance instead of pining for some pure ideal that's never going to happen, and wouldn't turn out as they expected anyway.","1270091544"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I wasn't comparing them. I was merely pointing out the fact that the weathermen are one of many examples of violent leftist groups. Just like there are violent conservative groups. 

Whether or not my example occurred 40 years ago has no bearing on my point. I'll restate for you one more time, cause I like you - the statement ""The danger of political violence in America comes overwhelmingly from one direction -- the right, not the left."" is wrong. Why? Because there have been violent leftist groups and violent conservative groups.

Of course I agree that the violent conservative groups are more of a concern *today*. Everybody paying attention knows that. But to denote conservatives as more inherently violent than liberals is a foolish position. Everyone has a tipping point. Your quickness to anger, along with zahlman's, just proves that. I'm assuming you both consider yourself liberals since you are so vehemently arguing against me, despite the fact that I am also a liberal. Like I stated in my first post, your inflammatory attitude is off-putting and serves no purpose besides making it easy to compare you to the very people you are so angry at.

The problem I can see with this is an electrical circuits issue relating to transmission lines and interrupting voltage/current combined with limitations of the instruments used to measure voltage &amp; current.  

A switch with a transmission line like this (a cable by any other name) doesn't respond the way they think it does in terms of transient currents and voltages.  On top of that, the instruments used to measure current and voltage have performance limitations that could obfuscate and mimic their claims based on wrong measurement assumptions without actually having the effect being valid.

Making electrical measurements of this type are not trivial.  Have 30 years experience in measurements like this and get paid big bucks to design stuff that actually measures correctly what other attempts fail at.

Which makes it Jund and it's not that difficult to play though more difficult than RDW it's still possible to make misplays and lose because of that.  It's pretty ridiculous the type of (bad) plays people make when they've made like top 8 or whatever just because they've gotten lucky.  One of the ideas that's floating around is that because there's so much Jund and mirror match is pretty much a coin flip it's possible for complete noobs to only play other noobs and reach the top playing only jund and winning only because of pretty much luck of draws/matching instead of any real skill.  Which makes it pretty unfortunate.  :(

Ew DiceHouse.  The prices there are atrocious and no offense, but from what I've seen the level of play isn't that great.  Though I'm sure the people are pretty nice and all the prices mainly are a huge turn off.  You should check out legendarylotus in Orange.

The owner is awesome and they host tons of events.  I mainly go to the drafts on Tuesdays, but they have standard tournaments on Monday and Fridays.  They also have very normal prices :)  I won't be at the draft next Tuesday cause of prior engagements, but you should definitely come around.  Lots of EDH goes down as well.

For example Dicehouse iirc does drafts for $15 while the drafts on Tuesday are $10 and winner gets $20 in credit.  Fees for standard tournaments are $5 with prizes fluctuating based on number of players and whatnot.  Can't hurt to come around once and see how it is though I guess if dicehouse is closer it makes it nicer.

C-41 is the process for developing color negative film. 

E-6 is much more appealing to look at, and is used professionally because vast numbers of rolls can be looked through rapidly because one can see the image with a loupe on a lightbox without reversing the colors. Also, E-6 renders color more accurately than c-41.

C-41, however, has incredible dynamic range (somewhere in the are of 20 stops. digital and chrome have ~13 stops at best). C-41 can also be stored longer at room temperature (E-6 should be refrigerated). Negative film is overall forgiving; chrome film is not.","1270091701"

Because of a jury instruction. The case looks like it was remanded (sent back to the jury) but the article says: 

&gt; the prosecutors and the Archdiocese of New Jersey agreed to keep Fugee away from children.

That means plea bargain. Not innocent. Why keep him away from children if he didn't actually do it?

Of course, there are some who were falsely accused, but the church needs to err on the side of caution here and not reinstate those who committed the crime but got off for whatever reason. 

At least give them a job that doesn't put them in a position of trust and exposure to the community, not fully reinstate them as priests.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","College ""lugs"" (lesbians until graduation) want to be able to sell themselves as virgins when hunting for a sugar daddy.

Once you eat beaver, you've had sex, and are no longer a virgin. The same goes for any non-penetrative intercourse involving genital to genital, oral to genital, oral to anal, genital to anal or genital/anal to object contact (involving two or more participants). The use of penetration as a metric for gauging virginity is so women can delude themselves into maintaining their ""pure little princess"" act.

Misconceptions about this issue lead to people honestly believing that women can't commit rape. Catholic nuns, for example, who shove little children's heads into their crotches have most certainly raped them.","1270091742"

If those points were money, which it sounds like they would be, then would a company really pay you for brushing your teeth? They may offer a discount for you, but is the government going to spend time regulating that portion of a point system just so Colgate can sell more toothpaste?

When I was younger I used to go to a lot of clubs, my friends and I would always get up and dance whenever rappers delight by the sugarhill gang would play and we'd really get into it. Some guy saw us and  got in the middle of us and started dancing quite well (I think he was trying to pick up my friend). Now I had learned to dance by going to classes and watching dvds because in my mind women were impressed by a man who can dance (turns out I was wrong or I just looked freaky) so I started doing a few moves, before I knew it there was a circle of people around me and the other guy cheering us on (even as this was happening I felt like i was in some bad movie), I tried and pulled off a few moves that were well beyond my skill level. I felt elated afterwards and didn't feel any pain, possibly because I'd had a few drinks, but as the night went on my right knee swelled to twice it's size and a friend took me to A&amp;E.

They are really good at making estimates, but if the customer lies or is unprepared (boxes aren't sealed, beds aren't taken apart, keep adding things items while we're there, etc.) then we go over the estimate and they get pissed... I think that's where a lot of people waste money for nothing.

There's no need to argue with the twisted logic that ""most cases weren't"" instead, why don't we say ""OK, I disagree, but what about the cases you apparently agree were?"". It really only takes one to make you a pedophile...

But, would I kill my child if God instructed me to. I don't know. Probably not. But if I didn't do it, it would be because of my own weakness and not because I wanted to hold God to my own morality.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Netanyahu's conditions (not official Likud plaform) are ""he state being demilitarized, without an army or control of their airspace"". This is not, I think, ""clearly two states"" per your original claim.

Please don't put words in my mouth. I said that his Bar-Ilan talk stated that he agrees in his own arguable terms for a Palestinian state west to the river. By arguable terms I referred to the demilitarization. No contradiction here.

&gt; There seems to be no formal repudiation of the 1999 platform

The repudiation of a platform is the next platform. I thought I referred you to the next platforms but I guess I was wrong. 

&gt; Unlike you *and the [Israeli Democracy Institute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Democracy_Institute)*, Israel's biggest paper interpreted their 1999 platform as still the latest word as of 2008; I'd expect them to know of anything more recent.

Additionally, the fact that kids are taught about ""bleeding = oh shit!"" way before they hear about periods may well be evidence on the patriarchy to which I spoke of.  When kids are brought up with a healthy understanding and celebration of both male and female bodies and their functions they're not surprised/scared when they're confronted with it when they grow up.  But when menstruation is hidden (or at least not talked about) from boys and girls early on it's a  way of indicating to them that it's a subject or event that is not acceptable, or unusual, or bad.  This creates the stigma that all blood is bad as opposed to having those conversations early and making it quite accepted, understood and maybe even celebrated that there's a different special kind of blood that is not harmful at all.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Who said anything about PC. And even if, I see Valve coming up with new franchises all the time, which are selling in millions, mostly on PC. There are many Indie games on XBL and PSN that sold in substantial amounts, which by taking out publisher middle man are very profitable. To name few: Fat Princess, Shadow Complex, soon to be released Breach, and few lesser known smaller projects like Braid, World of Goo. All this games have one major common thing; they are very high quality products, with a lot of innovation and low price, as well as a great accesibilty (all you need is a bank card with funds on). The marketing via internet is essentially free, as long as done properly. Free media websites like Youtube plus an effective viral marketing plus a very good product spreads information like wild fire. Just look at this website here, how many not well known games got great publicity just 'cause they were interesting, and all it took was one person stumbling upon a video somewhere.

I wont deny that gaming went mainstream and most of the revenue can be made from the solid franchises spewed out from the publishers evil machine with as few risks as possible, but being an indie developer assures MOST of the profits to go the people who made the game, and there is no need to give away almost 80% of profits to publishers and high street selling points. 

I have seen an article somewhere about comparision of indie developments and mainstream development, and an average indie studio need to sell 50.000 copies of their game to make similiar profits to 500.000 sold copies of ""published"" game - yes that's how much middle men and investors take away.

Great example of a profitable Indie studio is S2, they have no publisher for Heroes of Newerth, at this moment they have around 250.000 beta accounts (many are for the same person), while it's still closed beta. Will see what open beta will show, but trust me, they will make a lot of money, most likely just enough to pay staff wages, upkeep further content development and server fees and create a starting budget for the next product. I really don't see anything bad with that, as you don't need millions saved in your bank accounts to be succesfull as long as you can keep your company running, pay decent wages, and create new excting products - which is what the large corporations fail to see.

Edit: Oh and yes, something that is in every home, used by all members of every family, and being able to run games will never die, no matter how hard the companies like Sony or Microsoft will try.","1270092011"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Former criminal lawyer here.  A few points.

Pay attention to how everyone else conducts themselves.  Jail has its own rules and they are different from what you're used to.  I'm not talking about the rules created by the people running the jail (although those matter too), but the ones created by the people locked up in it.  Sometimes the rules of the jailors and those of the jailed will be in conflict, in which case you will have to make a judgment call on which to accord priority.  

Also, you have the advantage of knowing you're going to jail before you go, which gives you the chance to think about what you will do if certain circumstances arise (a threat, being hit, seeing someone else being hit or beaten up, etc.).  It's hard to do this effectively if you know nothing about jail, but it's still worth thinking about ahead of time so that you are less likely to rush into the wrong course of action.

I don't want to scare you, but better you go in knowing what to expect.  If you are careful and respectful (without being submissive) you should be able to do 45 days without trouble.

Do not look into anyone else's cell.  It is known as their ""house"" and the only way anyone has any privacy is by following this rule.

If a fight breaks out, or one person attacks another, do not get involved, no matter how wrong you might think it is.  You don't know what's going on and you could come in on the wrong side.  More to the point, it's against the informal rules (unless you've been there long enough to have friendships that are accepted by others, and even then it's a risk).  People are expected to fight their own fights.  Besides, the guy you jump in to help may be a total prick and you could get yourself seriously hurt, or even killed on his account.  

I don't know where you are, but in some places you should not address the guards yourself.  There are ""corridor men"" (guys higher up the totem pole) who talk to the guards and you can do it through them.  This may or may not apply in your area, so like I said, watch what others do.

Do not lean over the food or let your hands pass over it or hair hang over it (if you have long hair) when you are being served.  The risk of dirt or grunge or snot or dandruff or whatever falling off you and into the food is minimal at best, but it is bad form to take the chance of accidentally adulterating someone else's food.  If someone is in a bad mood, this alone can be enough to cause a fight.

In most places people on the outside can put money into an account for you, which you can then use to get stuff from the canteen, like cigarettes.  It's a cliche, but one that is true, that cigarettes are useful in jail to earn someone else's goodwill or bribing them not to do something nasty to you, so even if you don't smoke, get some, or get whatever everyone else is getting (magazines are also good, because the person you give them to can read them *and* pass them on after they're done, getting goodwill in their turn -- unlike cigarettes, magazines aren't used up once you're finished with them... obvious, but important in this context.)

Make sure you have someone on the outside who knows to put money into your account and who will accept your phone calls because all your calls will be collect and if something goes wrong, or you start to feel panicky, access to someone who cares about you -- even briefly on a payphone -- can be invaluable.

That's all that comes to mind just now.  Good luck dude.

P.S.  As someone who, like you, had to sober up to get his life right, good on you for stopping drinking.  Do what you have to to stay sober -- it will suck at times, but it's definitely worth it.","1270092019"

"Autos","t5_2qhr3","I usually hold the opinion that if cars were actually a little harder to drive, people would pay more attention and probably get in fewer accidents. 

I see your point, but I don't think those examples are the same as manual versus auto. Each of those functions can be varied in their assistance, providing more power or more mechanical feedback as needed. For example, my car uses one of the first (if not the first) instances of electric power steering assist. It's a big improvement over a pneumatic system because it's simpler, lighter, and the amount of power assist can be finely tuned to match the driving characteristics of the car. So even though it's not as mechanically pure as the examples you listed, I don't feel like it takes away from the driving experience the same way an automatic transmission does. 

When I go back to an automatic, one of the things that stands out most to me is how disconnected I feel. I actually notice that I'm more prone to space out when driving an automatic, and the more we move toward cars being ""comfort appliances"", the more likely this is to be true for most drivers.

It is a cold fact that this kind of activity only adds fuel to the cult machine.

If the protest group really wanted to do everyone a favor, they would set up a state or federal investigation for child abuse, and try to get the younger ones out of that brain-washing madness.

Am I really the only one who is aware that the WBC holding up the ridiculous signs are not the enemy - they are victims of Fred Phelps who would never sit in the light of day and hold one of his own signs. He hides behind a camera and makes no public appearances.

Get a nice salmon fillet, vermouth, heavy cream, mushrooms and green beans. Slice the mushrooms, cut the ends off of the beans.

Saute the mushrooms in 1T of butter or olive oil over medium high heat in a pan large enough to hold the salmon fillet, until done--about 2m. Hold the mushrooms, in a warm oven or cover in a bowl.

Wipe out the pan, then pour in about ~1.5C vermouth, and add the salmon, sprinkle with salt and cover with lid. Cook over medium heat until the salmon is done (when you can separate the flakes of the fish with a fork and it's opaque--about 5 mins.

Remove the fish and place on a plate. Cover to keep warm, or move to a warm (200 degree f) oven. 

Bring vermouth to a boil and reduce to about 1/2c (it should be thick and syrup-like). Add 1/2c of heavy cream and the mushrooms. Bring to simmer. Salt and pepper to taste. Add some fresh dill or chevril if you like, as well.

While the sauce is reducing, saute the green beans in about 1t butter or olive oil. They should be bright green, and still a bit crisp.

On plates, arrange the green beans, portion the salmon and place on top of the beans, and pour some of the mushroom sauce over the salmon. Serve with french bread and a nice Sauvingon Blanc. 

Easy, takes about 20m from start to finish, and very French. Make sure to get a nice piece of salmon, though.","1270092127"

I urge you to remember that the Genome project's speed and revolutionized capabilities were the result of machinery developed privately, for profit.

However, I do inherently agree that the patents are shortsighted and are drastically limiting _current_ scientific progress, and their holders have profited enough to warrant their work in the first place. 

Secondly: The plants that grow where I live do not grow where you live, at least many do not. The ecosystem where I am is rather balanced, and the plant species competing against one another have, over a long period of time, adapted to one another and no one species of weed or grass or tree (etc) drastically out competes another. 

If you introduce plant species which are not native, especially highly invasive plants that are adapted for harsher climates, they can (and have) totally fucked natural ecosystems, as the natural plants are completely unfit to compete against this new species. As a result, they cannot adapt fast enough and many local species die out or have their numbers drastically reduced under the heavy competitive influence of the invader.

That is why many plants are outlawed.

However, marijuana is outlawed mainly because it became associated with the lower class, and then with crime, vagrancy, and all that is _indecent_ for public. During the blue law craze, it was illegalized. However, unlike other vices, it was not nearly as pervasive and thus didn't enjoy widespread use and support by influential and powerful members of society.

It was then transformed into the ""scary drug"" that many people think it is today, and too much time has passed since it's illegalization for people to really understand the why and how behind it. Hence the battle against public perception we fight.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Many years ago I applied for a job that, when I went to the facility, left me with a genuinely creepy impression of the people I would be working with. To ""test the waters,"" and because I didn't want the job based on my impressions, I gently and tactfully asked the company receptionist if she had an ""extra"" cigarette. I not only didn't get the cigarette, but my action not only quickly found its way all over that company, but quickly also all the way back to the person who had recommended the company to me. It was as if I had poured gasoline on a fire. I was amazed, but not surprised, that my experimental, deliberate baiting of the receptionist produced such dramatic results. My concerns about this company had proved to be legitimate. The place was a real shark tank, and I had just introduced enough blood in the water to send the entire company into a feeding frenzy. What a fascinating experience. I learned to employ similar techniques when exploring other questionable work environments, but the response to this one was particularly vicious, and highly informative.","1270092133"

I don't have a lot of latitude at work to express frustration, as the people in the area I work with are fairly quiet and don't take well to verbal exclamations. Ironically, the one who brought up my occasional ranting is the one who rants the most herself. We're both somewhat highly strung, but I think I'm slightly less-so than she is.

I've never really seen it as something I absolutely have to change, because the way I see it is that I vent my frustration about something for a very short period of time, have a laugh about the ridiculousness of the situation, and then totally forget about it and move on.

However, people who don't react like this and either bottle it up (not healthy) or just care less about it, or just aren't the venting types sometimes raise my tendency to vent and ask me to tone it down.

Most of my friends and family are used to me and find my rants kind of funny and have a laugh with me about them. Others, including my boyfriend, pbviously, find them a bit stressful to hear. I guess the laugh at the end doesn't cut through the tension the same way for them as it does for me.

Also, to be fair, I haven't been laughing much at the ridiculousness of my work situation lately because I'm pretty despondent about my chances of getting out and into a better-paying, more fulfilling and challenging job.

I guess I'm still going to try to accept it cerebrally (life *is* suffering, after all) in order to make my workday bearable until I can find something better.","1270092206"

That's not the statement I made. I said reddit is being hypocritical for preaching tolerance while being intolerant wherever they feel it's OK. This is hypocritical because people who are racist *think it's OK to hate black people*, and practising the behaviour that you preach against in others is hyprocritical.

&gt; There is no nation where this is such the norm that he dresses like this because those of his culture do. Yet again, if you can't tell the difference between cultural traits and an idiot fad, that's your failing. 

No there is no such nation, but that doesn't make it an idiot fad, just a fad. And even if it is demonstrably only a fad for people with below-some-level IQs then that still isn't justification for ridiculing people who partake in it.

&gt; This guy wasn't born in a nation where this is the norm for men, so your comparison to arabs being called sand niggers because of their birthplace is faulty.

But he has picked it up from his surroundings where it is considered normal and acceptable. (Presumably - this particular person might indeed be taking the piss, but a general person looking like that wouldn't be).

Nobody has a choice until they realise they can choose differently, but then still choose that way. Either way, if it's not about hurting people then it's not really justification for laughing at them. Isn't the whole idea of America the land of freedom and pursuit of happiness? Isn't 'free thinking' held up as a general western ideal?

&gt; I can see what you really wanted to do here was display how self righteous and enlightened you think you are. 

How enlightened I want to be.

&gt; Unfortunately you've exposed your lack of understanding of the difference between culture and what this guy has done to himself.

Unfortunately, you've decided that out of the blue, without any influence from his surroundings, he decided ""I need to buy and apply fake tan, that's normal"" and also decided ""that makes him look stupid"" and also decided ""if I think he looks stupid then I am justified in laughing at him"". All three links in the chain have big weaknesses.

&gt; If you can't figure this out yourself, try unpopping your collar, it might be blocking the flow of blood to the brain.

My choice of look is not his choice of look, but no doubt you would find ways to call it stupid. I can barely imagine how many indie people are laughing at my *blue jeans*.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm all in favour of intellectualism, like at mises.org, but unfortunately the vast majority of intellectualism in the USA is not intellectualism at all, but more like intellectual bullshitting to justify socialist philosophies in economics and government.  It amounts to nothing other than complicated and nuanced rationalisations for taking other peoples money and property.  You don't need a degree to know that these people are full of shit, and to tell them to fuck off.

The Federal reserve is a classic example.  They have an entire army of highly educated economists, but in the end ... they only exist for one purpose, and that is to justify fradulent money creation and government spending.   Global warming was another example till climate-gate caused people to take another look, and as soon as they did - half a dozen scandals broke out relating to the IPCC, NASA, and so on.  Another common one is health care.   All these theories that came out about how the free market can't provide effective coverage and insurance was complete absolute bullshit.  Fuck you couldn't even reason with them without getting this big cluster-fuck of logic that tangled up insurance, charity, distributed funding, and government funding without any distinction or common sense.

I don't want an intelligent person in government, I want someone who will stay the fuck out of the way.   That is the most important qualification, bar-none.   Intelligence is the rest of our jobs.  Jobs we can do better if they just stay the fuck out.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","In December, I went to Israel for the first time on Birth Right.  I think you should all hear about it. 

While I will support Israel with my life, I think that both Israelis and Palestians are at fault.  Life in Gaza and the West Bank is hard, but so is life in Israel.  

There is an Israeli town a few miles from Gaza.  Every time there is unrest, kaytusha rockets fly overhead and kill indiscriminately.  The people who live in the town cannot move because all of their equity is tied into their homes, and the real estate price has plummeted.  There is a clothing company that designs shirts telling the stories of the people in this town, and the proceeds from the shirts go to the town and its citizens.

Don't look to borders and politics.  Palestinians and Israelis are all human, and, despite the past, all deserve clean water, education, access to health care, and the ability to participate in a political process.  I am not saying Israel is at fault, nor am I saying the Arab community is (although, historically, both share some culpability, but for different reasons).  

Both Palestinians and Israelis live with death and threat every day.  Both have a history of pain, atrocities, and assassinations.  Did you know an Israeli leader was assassinated for his work in the peace process?  Yitzhak Rabin.  By a Jew.  Did you know an Arab President was killed for making a peace deal with Israel?  Anwar Sadat; he was killed by a fellow Egyptian.  Both resort to aggressive behavior because they feel they have no choice.  

Israelis and Palestinians need to focus on that which brings them together, not that which divides them.  Jews and Muslims have a rich history of mutual respect and religions based on may similar tenants.  If you want peace, have the Arab soldiers visit a Jewish military cemetery and have the Jewish soldiers do the same.  Then again, that might be too idealistic.   

I don't know what can be done for the peace process, but the first step should be the US backing the fuck away.  As much as I love Israel, she can stand on her own, and intervention by foreign powers has never, ever proven to be conducive to peace.  Take Mossadeq in Iran, the Mujaheddin in Afghanistan, Nasser in Egypt, and the list goes on.  The only thing foreign intervention has done is increase support for extremists.  

So Obama, can you leave Israel alone?  Yes, you can.  Can the Middle East save itself?  God, I hope so.  ","1270092355"

"math","t5_2qh0n","* **Edit**: Here's a (in some sense, closed) example. 

Let `f(0) = 0, f(2) = 3, f(3) = -2`, `f(x) = x+1` for `1 &lt; x &lt; 2`, `f(x) = 1-x` for `2 &lt; x &lt; 3`, `f(x) = 3+(1/x)` for `0 &lt; x &lt; 1`, for `f(x) = 1/(3-x)`, for `x &gt; 3`, and `f(x) = -f(-x)` for `x &lt; 0`. 

* Formal statement:

&gt; A function `f` satisfies `f(f(x)) = -x` iff there exists a subset `A ⊂ ℝ+` and a bijection `g: A -&gt; (ℝ+)\ A` such that `f(0) = 0`, `f|A = g`, `f|((ℝ+)\ A) = -g^{-1}`, and `f(-x) = -f(x)` for `x &lt; 0`. In particular, `A` and `g` uniquely define `f`.

* Informally:

&gt; Pick a subset `A ⊂ ℝ+`, and let `B` be the remaining positive reals. Find a one-to-one function `g` that maps `A` to `B`, so that its inverse function `h` maps `B` to `A`. Then `f` is of the form: `f(x) = g(x)` for all `x` in `A`, and `f(x) = h(x)` for all `x` in `B`. We can extend this to all real numbers using the oddness property of `f`. 

* Proof:

&gt; The claim is not hard to verify (as long as caution is taken with the signs): we know that `f` is odd so `f(0) = 0`, and we know that `f` is bijective: `f(x) = f(y) ==&gt; -x = f(f(x)) = f(f(y)) = -y` and `x = f(f(-x))`. For any such `f`, let `A = {x | x &gt; 0, f(x) &gt; 0}`, and let `g = f|A`. Then, for `x &gt; 0` not in `A`, we have `f(f(x)) = -x ==&gt; 0 &gt; f(x) = f^{-1}(-x) = -f^{-1}(x) ==&gt; f^{-1}(x) &gt; 0`, so `0 &lt; x = f(y) = g(y)` for some positive number `y` (bijectivity), and then `f(x) = -g^{-1}(x)` as desired. The rest follows from oddness.


&gt; The other direction is straightforward, as if `x` is in `A` then `f(f(x)) = f(g(x)) = -g^{-1}(g(x)) = -x`; and if `x &gt; 0` is not in `A` then `f(f(x)) = f(-g^{-1}(x)) = -f(g^{-1}(x)) = -g(g^{-1}(x)) = -x`.   

* Comment:

See **4609287645**'s post for an explicit example with `g(x) = x+1, A = (0,1] ∪ (2,3] ∪ ... ∪ (2n, 2n+1] ∪ ...`; another would be `g(x) = 2x` and `A = ∪_{n∈ℤ}  (2^(2n),2^(2n+1)]`. ","1270092405"

Gatecrashed a yakuza beach party, and drank all their sake. Apparently they picked up my drunk ass, carried me back to our camp and dropped me on the sand. Did I mention I was wearing a bikini this whole time?

Climbed a mountain with my friend (no prep or anything just took off in the middle of the night), so we could watch the sun rise from the top. We get to the top, climb on top of the ski lift (it was in summer) and he magically produces a bottle of wine from his pocket. Took us till about 10am to get down &gt;_&lt;

Calorie wise, they are about even when comparing greek lowfat and normal light yogurts.  Just like with any yogurt, the biggest issue is the fruit flavoring they add.  Most of the greek yogurt I have tried (oikos, chobani, fage) use real fruit and sugar (no HFCS / Articificalstuff) for sweetener which can add up pretty quickly if your having multiple cups (chobani seems to be the highest at about 19g per serving for their fruit on the bottom varieties) but I think is still better for you than the chemical sweetener they use in normal fat free light yogurts.","1270092428"

These may take some time; if you can, in the interim, look into crate training- crate Ginger while you are out of the home, or gate her into part of the house- away from the door, so your mother can escape unmolested. If needs be, fill a Kong or other toy with a treat, offer it to the dog, then close the gate or leave from the door while Ginger is occupied.

You didn't seem to indicate that it's a policy by saying, ""sometimes it's fine,"" indicating to me that you are sometimes ok with having sex on your period.

The OP and most of those replying seemed (to me) to indicate that they have a blanket policy of no sex on their or their partner's periods.  Perhaps I assumed too much, but I believe that based on the OP's replies to mine below that my assumption was correct at least for the OP.","1270092480"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There is no scientific evidence that explains NDEs. The number of heart attack victims who have NDEs is estimated at between 4% and 18%. If it were scientific evidence, and biologic the number would be 100% would it not? There is scientific evidence that when the brain is deprived of oxygen some will see a light, and a feeling of euphoria. But here's the thing, why does the work of God have to be ""unscientific""?

Also what of people that have spiritual encounters when they are awake? There are stories of children and adults who say they have seen angels, and other ""heavenly"" spirits.  Or people who see spirits of long dead relatives?  Do you suppose that they are all delusional?  Or do you suppose that there is some big conspiracy?

When you consider the big bang theory, do you believe it? I know I do.  But we cannot test it and we have not seen it have we? We believe that it is a solid theory because of background radiation and the fact that all of the universe seems to be moving away, it is expanding. You will open your eyes to that, but you will not open your eyes to evidence that is just as compelling.  If 100 people said I saw Mr. X rob the Kwiki mart and shoot Apu, you would be inclined to convict Mr. X.  But if 10,000 people say I saw an angel you say that they are lying or deluded or hallucinating. Don't you find it odd that they all see essentially the same thing?

I'm not trying to convince you there is a God, and I'm not trying to convince you to accept a religion.  But I do want everyone to open their eyes.

The young and sometimes older people, see a wide chasm between religion and science.  I do not. I consider myself a Christian, and I think science is fascinating because it shows how God created the universe and everything in it. I think an interesting question is, ""Was this the only way for God to create the universe?"" Does God follow the laws of physics, or did he create them.

Is the bible infallible? I certainly don't think so, but I'm no biblical expert.
The king James bible is a translation, and literal interpretation of course of the original Greek and Aramic Bibles.

However many of the stories are very close to the original. Do you not find the creation story in Genesis to be fairly well aligned with what actually happened?  I mean the book says, in the beginning there was nothing. Thing about that word ""nothing"".  It doesn't say there were no planets or stars, it says there was nothing. It doesn't say the universe was empty, it says nothing. Well, that is spot on correct is it not?","1270092514"

Remember the way Bioshock fucked with your head? Yeah well... Breakdown also has a senses-shattering twist, the key difference being Breakdown's is as much of a twist, and the story is just as enjoyable on your 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 10th play through. The story doesn't fall apart as shallow and gimicky the way Bioshock's did. And as for the rest of it? Extreme immersion. From the start of the game until the ending credits you never once leave the first person perspective. And I should mention that it doesn't have cut-scenes. Why? Because cut-scenes are for lame, lesser developers to use as a way to tell the story because they aren't clever enough to bake it into the actual gameplay.

There are no levels, no cut-scenes, no sudden switch to 3rd person, no bs to break the game world's reality in any way. It is a ride so tremendous I'm tempted to suggest you pick up a used original xbox just so you can check it out.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I think a good way of arguing this is to talk about ethical questions raised by hypothetical technology.

* If we had artificial wombs that could grow a child from conception then would 
abortion be acceptable?
* If the baby was grown in an artificial womb by anonymous donor eggs and a father's sperm then could the father choose to abort?
* If the baby was grown in an artificial womb then which of the parents would have abortion rights? Would they be equal? If there's a disagreement would a court decide?
* If we had teleportation that could remove a fetus without any concern for the mother's health then would we accept abortion?

With sufficient technology the fetus's growth is independent of being inside or outside the body and the 9 month timeframe seems more arbitrary:

&gt; ""Some pro-life groups argue that this would allow a father to have a choice in whether to carry a pregnancy  to term. Some people would even argue that this would make it acceptable to ban abortion, since the fetus would be able to survive outside of the uterus from the first day, thereby avoiding any possible undue burden. Some currently pro-choice people may even find it acceptable to ban abortion  if artificial uteri become available, since the woman would still be allowed to have the fetus removed from her body."" ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_uterus))

Also there are non-technological reasons:

* If the mother or father wasn't ready for children (economically, emotionally) then would we accept abortion as a lesser evil?
* If there's a massive population then would we accept abortion?
* If it's the product of a rape would we accept abortion?

Naturally when we solve technology problems we're left with economic/emotional reasons. I think those are strong arguments in favour of abortion: that if a couple can't take care of a kid then they should be able to abort because they couldn't give a good future for that child. This may mean that people have several months after they learn of the pregnancy to decide.

Until this technology exists though I'm happy with the mother having the right to choose abortion.","1270092555"

Civil rights for African-Americans weren't simply won by MLK, but were part of a long struggle of a lot of people, [many of whom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacons_for_Defense_and_Justice) used violence to defend Black communities.

Since, you seem to use it for Movies... have  you checked out Miro?

$ sudo apt-get install miro

or the youtube downloader:

$ sudo apt-get install youtube-dl

then, from a shell you can do: 

$ youtube-dl ""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVTWCPoUt8w"" 

Then, you can convert it into mpg or mp3 using some info from here: http://tips.webdesign10.com/youtube-downloader-linux

If you're going to get into terminal based stuff, then I highly recommend Yakuake. It's a dropdown console with a hotkey

$ sudo apt-get install yakuake

or you might find gnome-do interesting. It's a quick launcher for files / music / programs etc in a similar vein to Quicksilver / finder for mac.

$ sudo apt-get install gnome-do gnome-do-plugins gnome-do-docklets

It's also activated as a hotkey or it can be setup as a dock on the bottom bar like MacOSX dock (personally, I'm not a fan).

If you get stuck with some commands, you can usually do:

$ &lt;command_name&gt; --help 

or

$ man &lt;command_name&gt;

I believe the shininess (lustre) of metals comes from the fact that they have lots of free electrons coursing around within them and at the surface.

So what happens if, by introducing a large magnetic field or some other electro-motive force, we convince a lot of electrons to vacate one side of a piece of metal? Does the metal get less shiny? Could we ever make the metal actually dull? What would it look like?

Conversely, can we make something more shiny by pumping electrons into it?

Similarly, can you see a change in lustre if you introduce an electric field across a semiconductor?","1270092615"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","I have a fixwell knife in my desk drawer.  They are great for 
cutting fruit.

I usually have an orange or grapefruit which I cut in half and
then cut an inch swath around the peel and then eat each
half like a bowl.  You can hold a kleenex in your hand to keep
the juices from getting all over your desk if you get  a
particularly juicy fruit.  But normally this isn't necessary.

Then I have an apple which I slice into rounds with the knife.
I also cut the peel off of the rounds but sometimes I also
end up eating the peels as well.

I take half a sandwich but make sure you use good bread.
America lost its way in the 60's and 70's when they started
making that bread full of air and white flour.

I also have a bag full  of spinach and then a few strawberries
or carrots or whatever is in season and cheap which I cut up
with my fixwell knife.

I also have a small bag of chips or cheetos from the vending
machine.  

Also when I make the half sandwich and spinach I put them in
the old type plastic bag with the flap-over.  I hate the small
zip-lock ones for this purpose.

The main thing for me is that I know I am going to eat healthy
fruit and vegetable about four times a week.

The frustrating part is that unless a post is more than five or so paragraphs long, I don't consider it ""tl;dr"". Five paragraphs is... very very short. And I can usually tell from the first paragraph (which is maybe ten seconds of reading) that I want to continue. I've never understood how people can be so paradoxical in this context.

The scientific study of their victimization and physical attacks happen in the universities, government houses, halls of justice, and hospitals.
Child pornography is studied in these same universities, government houses, halls of justice, and hospitals.

Our laws protect those studying how to solve the problem and heal the victims.  Making illegal horrific acts or fantasies, does not stop good science.

Rape or molestation fantasies are like shouting fire in a crowded theatre. That type of free speech is not protected, and rape or molestation fantasies should continue to be socially unacceptable and hopefully, soon, illegal as well. Rape erotica is the same as child pornography to me. Horrific. The acts are both illegal, and any media depicting these topics in a positive manner should be illegal and punishable by harsh sentences and fines.

"electronicmusic","t5_2qmh1","i second what Jarkeler said. I would also say that this type of electronic music might not be your type (yet). in the beginning I would not have taken kindly to this song. I started off with trance, and still like it. If you are curious about you should try all the genres. Most people start off with Trance. You might be missing something because the stuff you might have been listening to could have been more technoish? maybe? which doesn't have all the emotions of a regular song. Try stuff with vocals. 

Anyway, some good upbeat tracks would be Three Drives - Greece 2000. or a fairly new one Jochen Miller - Brace Yourself.

as far as vocals go, try something by Gabriel and Dresden. 

best of luck, and if you don't enjoy it then don't force it, it might not be your style. but definitley the electronic enfluences are taking over the pop scene in america.

People seem to think bias is equal to terrible journalism. It isn't. All media companies/outlets have a bias, because guess what? Journalists has biases! The Australian has some of the best political commentary in the country but to say they don't have a right-wing bias is ridiculous, (just as ridiculous to say that Crikey don't have a left-wing bias). Bias is inevitable, and it isn't a problem as long as you're aware of it; as long as you think to yourself, ""Ok, what are they trying to get at here"" or ""Is this the full story?"" bias isn't an issue.

If you after as little bias as possible in your political commentary then the general consesus among political scientists is that Michelle Grattan provides the best ""un-biased"" analysis.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","This is very misleading.  There are criminal conspiracy laws in the federal code and in every state.  These don't just have to do with conspiring to overthrow the government, you can be charged with conspiracy to commit any felony.  For example, conspiracy to traffic cocaine.

There are two types of laws defining conspiracy.  Some require an ""overt act.""  Some don't.  Florida, for example, does not.  The distinction is that under those laws requiring an overt act, you must take some concrete act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  For example, if you were conspiring to commit murder with someone, and you purchased gloves and a shovel, you can now likely be convicted.  In states (and I suppose in the federal code as to seditious conspiracy) where there is no overt act required, you can, so to speak, be guilty without doing anything.

But more often than not, a music album was simply 8-14 songs that made 50-75 minutes of recorded music that the record company would then release in an easily marketed format. 

Both exist.  And we hold up ""Kind of Blue"" by Davis or ""The Wall"" by Pink Floyd because they did something fucking major.    

But the major reason I like hunting through albums by artists I have found myself liking, it is in hunting for the gems that won't make the ""Greatest Hits"" release that comes 20+ years into their career.   Mainly because these are songs never charted on their own.   You see that in work by many musicians I like.... but a couple that really stand out to me would be Lou Reed and Warren Zevon.

* Limited unskilled labor allowed (only when an employer proves he cannot find an american worker)
* Zero tolerance on crime (if you read up a few posts in this thread, you'll see an I.C.E. officer talking about the majority of deportees he deals with have committed a crime)

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I recently went to a Catholic wedding for one of my best friends and had a similar experience.  During the priest's portion of the ceremony, he started out with flying colors.  My friend went to Catholic school and the priest has known him since high school.  So, the priest started out very funny, read parts of an email my friend sent him a year ago asking him to be part of the ceremony.  I guess he was mainly funny because of the quotes from my friend.  

Then, almost immediately, he went down in flames.  Went into talking not only about how much he loves teaching opera, but started quoting scripture left and right and got totally off topic.  The whole thing lasted about an hour.  Afterwards, everyone had the same review.  Even my friend, the groom, said the priest turned what was supposed to be 10 minutes into an hour (he didn't appreciate having to stand that long).  

Also, when my aunt died a few years ago, she explicitly had said that she did not want a religious ceremony.  Of course, my uncle (a devout christian, Catholic I think) took over the arrangements since he lives in the same city and my dad is 600 miles away.  Turned out to be in a church, lots of scripture.  I almost got up to say something about it, but I was fighting back tears and didn't want to cause a scene at the memorial service for a family member whom I loved so much.  

tl;dr: There are few things worse than disrespecting a person's wishes on one of the defining moments/memories of their life by injecting religion when they have made it known they do not want it to be present.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;To me, I couldn't be happy if I devoted my life to something I thought was probably not true/seriously doubted. I also believe that I can attain a lot more happiness and succeed in life if I am able to think critically about the world and my own life. If I fill my mind up with junk thoughts I'm more likely to fail, be let down and be generally unhappy.

I couldn't be happy under those circumstances either. But I've hardly *devoted my life* to anything. Think of it more like a hobby. It's fulfilling and it even helps me through the day, and it's fun to talk about as we're doing and learn more about it everyday.

&gt;There are things to believe in that are bigger than you and have evidence behind them. The world is a wonderful place and you don't have to add pixie dust to make a flower more beautiful-the flower is beautiful on it's own without supernatural ideas.

It's sort of uncanny how similar we think. Before I started drinking I was an atheist and this was pretty much my attitude for life. I saw the universe as an accident, but an incredibly beautiful accident. The fact that we were products of chance or probability only strengthened my respect for the beauty of life and the universe. You could say I was a pretty spiritual guy. Now that I'm somewhat of a believer, it doesn't change things: I'm still aware of and have great respect for the beauty in all things. It's not like I think the universe is nothing without god: if I'm wrong about there being a bigger, higher presence then we still have an amazing, glorious thing going on here. It isn't any less beautiful without a higher power.

&gt;That's great because you've mentioned ""without a doubt"" a few times before. The strongest thing anyone can ever do is admit they might be wrong and question things. You cannot learn if you're mind is already made up on something.

I think there's two meanings for the phrase ""without a doubt"" that are bouncing around right now. There's the one that calls to mind dangerous obsession, unquestioning, unflinching faith that's associated with 'extremist' ideologies and religions. And there's the one that's about not pulling your hair out about worry and not being struck with what I call paralysis analysis--a feeling of hopelessness or existential despair at not being able to **know** one way or the other. I struggled with this in early sobriety and I realized it wasn't helpful, it was just hurting me. After deciding that I wanted to be one way--believing--I decided to just drop all preconceived thoughts and instead try it out the way I wanted.

&gt;By letting in unfounded, probably false beliefs you are more likely to add more false beliefs to your acquired knowledge while potentially rejecting true ones I believe this will cause more harm in the future rather than the small benefits that believing false ideas might offer.

haha, you're making me sound like this nut job. I haven't *stopped thinking* for chrissake! I still question authority and new ideas, I still think critically. Now I'm sure that my belief in a higher power may have effects on the way I think about other things, sure, but I'm hardly living a doctrine. I live by one guiding principle: creating who I want to be. I think god doesn't give a damn what I become or decide to do: he's letting me do it after all. 
You might say ""BUT A_MAN YOU CAN'T JUST LIVE BY YOUR OWN RULES THAT'S WHAT LEADS TO PEOPLE BEING BOMBED AND SHIT WTF LOL BBQ did you stop and think that maybe it's not that he's letting you do it but no one's there to stop you?!"" Yes I did and that's why I pay attention to things like social norms and laws even though I might question them: man's experience is not to be discounted. But I have judgment and if I don't like Who I Am then there's nothing stopping me from becoming Who I Want To Be. 

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like the remainder of your comments/points and your whole stand on the matter can be summed up in the sentiment of ""If there is a god and it created the universe, why doesn't it show itself to me and to all people in a way that is convincing enough to make believers out of all of us? It hasn't done so yet obviously so it must be/probably is the case that no such entity exists.""
An excellent point, and the only thing I can refute that with is something that I *believe*. A thought. Let's assume there is a god and he is infinitely loving so he gives us the greatest gift of all, free will--the ability to choose and become Who We Want To Be. Some people have chose to be non-believers. And that is fine, this god wants us to be able to make this choice. If he were to show himself to us in a way that would be convincing enough to make believers out of everyone--*that would be removing our choice*. It would be taking away free will. This god is omnipotent in a way and can do a lot of things, but one thing he can't do is what we don't want. If he were to just *make* you believe, that would be a sort of violation of rights.

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","&gt; Anyway I know you're trying to communicate something to me, but I can't quite tell what it is.

The major points that I am making are that: 

A) People are superficial. They will judge you on the things that intellectually we shouldn't judge others. But you know what? Life is unfair. We judge people based on appearances far more than we do performance/personality --- at least as first. Let's face it, no one likes ugly people, but at least we have many opportunities to improve ourselves (i.e. working out, dressing well, etc. etc.) to get past that initial boundary. **You have to.**

B) Being the cocky and even asshole guy is far more beneficial with talking to girls and gaining their respect than being nice and being friendly. That's how it works. 

&gt; All I can see from my perspective (and I'm being perfectly serious) is that you're telling me I'm an inferior man.

Being honest is the first step in improving oneself. I was depressed at one point in my life --- and I was honest with myself. I tried tricking myself/saying to myself that i'm happy blah blah, but that is useless. Rather, the more realistic thing was to realize that there was a deficiency in me that was correctable and improving it. 

The point is that wherever there are inferior qualities, you recognize them and improve them. 

&gt; Perhaps you should read ""how to win friends and influence people"".

I have. The main point is to listen to others and be interested in them. It's not that difficult.

&gt; I resent you for calling me a failure

Never did. I just pointed out that not being fit, not looking sharp, being poor, spending time on the computer, are all hurting you. They are ALL correctable/easily improved upon. 

&gt; as it hurts people's feelings and makes them dislike you and want to go out of their way to make your life difficult.

You're a man and you're 21/22. This is the attitude of a soft man and you need to toughen up. You need to develop thick skin because girls can see through that. Don't become a douchebag, but learn to adopt a badass/i don't give a fuck what you say attitude. Low confidence doesn't work with girls. Also, working out makes you incredibly tougher and thick skinned than before. It's because of the increased testosterone production through the body and everyone knows low testosterone levels = low sex drive/low initiative to flirt/small talk with girls. 

&gt; They already know.

Identify the weak points, sob/feel sad at first, then improve on those points. I merely identified the points that **could** be improved upon that can make a big difference (and have worked for me and many others). 

Best of luck. 

Edit: **Sell the computer** and **stop whacking off to porn.**

I'm pretty sure there would be both as well as those in the middle such as indentured servants.

The lowest servants would have been cleaning feet as they were plastered with effluent from open sewers and animals in the street.

Jesus, as God, coming to Earth turns on its head the normal hierarchical system and His then dying as a sacrifice for men decimates the classical theistic hierarchy.

I do not believe that a person's self-selected placement on the liberal-conservative spectrum makes one more or less inherently violent.

You assume I'm liberal.  I'm quite libertarian and I believe that the liberal safety nets (welfare, etc...) often become self-perpetuating prisons without walls.

Here's what I think:  since the early 90s, certain radio and tv talking heads (I'm looking at you, Rush) have created an attitude of intolerance, gleeful ignorance, and perceived victimhood.  Civil discourse has become so uncivil since then.  Study the history of Germany, Serbia/Croatia/Yugoslavia, and the Congo.  Uncivil discourse and the ""otherizing"" of people with different attitudes, beliefs, or appearances.  We are in for a dark future unless people of all stripes come to terms with where we are at and where we are heading.

Pedophiles prefer tots, toddlers and prepubescents.  If you rape a 15 year old girl you're not going to be called a pedophile.  

It's pretty obvious to most, you're a heterosexual with a taste for molesting young girls.

Calling these ""priests"" pedophiles when they are clearly deviant homosexuals acting out is an example of the media inventing a way to give cover to a group they feel is deserving of gentle treatment.

For all of the ""accountability"" demanded of the church in the wake of this outrage it's disgraceful that journalists would misuse the term ""pedophile"" and ignore the blatant homosexuality many of these criminals displayed including: frequenting gay bars, bringing men home, AIDS, drag, etc.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I decide to start walking my dog (golden retriever) at 3am. It is pitch black out. And over the course of 40 minutes I keep running into an older lady walking her little dog. I don't really acknowledge her because I'm a guy big and I have my ipod on under my sweatshirt.

 Somehow I end up walking behind her and she is obviously nervous because she keeps slowing down trying to let me pass. Its one of those awkward moments where I don't think I can pass her in one stride so we would end up walking beside her for 30 seconds longer than I wanted - so I stop and mimic like I'm picking up dog shit. She picks up the pace and darts across the road to the other sidewalk. 

I'm like WTF?? It dawns on me that A)I'm standing behind a mail box looking like im trying to hide B)she must be super terrified that rape is imminent, It was pretty quirky to me so I decided to go with it. I darted to the other side of the road and followed her for another half a kilometer.

At this point i'm laughing to myself because this broad is obviously trying to lose me by going into a dark alleyway. I start running full speed at her so she bolts and eventually makes it on to the main road and shuffles into a convenience store. I decided to quit while I was ahead and go home. 

- In my 22 year old head it made perfect sense to fuel her fears that I was some kind of deranged stalker. 

- Technically its a story about me being the creeper.

- I troll little old immigrant ladies irl ;)

When we ""outsource"", first we get a small business contractor because it's required to get some small business represented, and then the rest of the code gets written in a Java sweatshop in Texas to cut costs. Although it's certainly plausible some contractors are outsourcing offshore down the line, I can't see what they'd gain by that. Every contract won underbids the real cost of the work, and once you get the contract it's more cost effective for the government to eat the cost overrun rather than switch contractors.

"Marijuana","t5_2qhhn","THC will stay in your system 21 days, tops.  You're 14 days clean, another week, you're fucking golden, man.  A cleanser certainly won't hurt but dude, you have to drink like a gallon of water when using them so you're going to need to pee like a racehorse though a 4 hour interview.  Study the cleanse instructions now and modify as you see fit.

However, if you have even a slightly above average metabolism you're going to be just fine even if you don't do anything.  Drink lots of water as others have suggested, a little cardio work will help not only the test but your health as well and hopefully you'll keep it up afterwards.

I've had county probation department drug test lab heads as hostile witnesses  say they were 99% certain I was clean even though I had smoked less than three days before (although I am a very light user).  I used golden seal in those cases but I am very fit with a high metabolism and drink tons of water by habit so I was doing well anyway.  YMMV.

"math","t5_2qh0n","I'm not smart enough to get a one-liner, but here's a solution that I found pretty intuitive.

Define a mapping from the reals to (-pi,pi) as such:

    g(x) = 2*atan(x) if x &gt;= 0
           -pi - 2*atan(x) if x &lt; 0

And the inverse:

    ginv(x) = tan(x/2) if x &gt;= 0
              tan(-pi/2 - x/2) if x &lt; 0

And a function to keep our angles in (-pi,pi):

    m(x) = x if x &lt;= pi
           x - 2*pi if x &gt; pi

Then you can have:

    f(x) = ginv(m(g(x) + pi/2))

Basically it maps all the numbers onto a circle so that negatives are on the opposite side of the circle from positives, and f rotates a quarter-turn each time.  Two quarter-rotations from x gets you to -x.","1270093203"

"trees","t5_2r9vp","I didn't miss your point, I understood what you're saying, but I don't think you're seeing mine. The capability to generate high lumens is weighted against the sensitivity we have to green light. Just because we can make a 400 lumen per watt green led doesn't mean you'll get the same efficiency in a red one or a blue one - bandgaps, diode composition ratios, everything is different, even in the EXACT SAME BATCH of diode chips.

And right now every LED maker is focused on lumens, which means they're marketing towards human light, and that PAR rating they tack on afterwards is a total aftersight. 

Just because we can pump out so much in one band doesn't mean we can adapt the same method for other bands. Different voltages are required, different amperages, different controllers. Too many factors.

I actually design diodes. It's NOT easy by any means, even though the very nature of a diode is ungodly simplistic.","1270093205"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt;When you purchase tires that are bigger than stock, the place recalibrates your speedo.

I'm not saying that's never happened, but I'm saying as a generic statement that's false.  Most large chains (or mom and pop shops) do not do this.

Some vehicles can have their speedometers recalibrated, [here](http://www.summitracing.com/search/Department/Gauges-Accessories/Part-Type/Speedometer-Recalibration-Devices/?Ns=Rank|Asc) is a sampling of those devices and how much they cost.  Bear in mind a manufacturer being listed to a device does not mean all vehicles made by that company can be recalibrated.

Some vehicles have speedometers that cannot be recalibrated.  To be made useful again, though, you can wire in an auxiliary device between the Vehicle Speed Sensor (either at the transmission output shaft or at the differential) to ""fool"" the ECU into thinking the speed is something different.

Some older vehicles (as new as '97 off the top of my head, may be some even newer) have mechanical speedometers that would require different gears to be recalibrated, a futile effort.

tl;dr It's the responsibility of the driver to know what size tires he has on his car and how that affects his instrumentation accuracy.  [Here's](http://www.miata.net/garage/tirecalc.html) a great tool to figure out the proportional inaccuracy.","1270093207"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;So I'll refrain from responding to it.

I was making a point refuting your sentence ""Also, he will gain some number of votes for taking the opposite stance, as well.""

(1) People who understand the middle east well enough to have an opinion that is the antithesis of AIPAC's are rare. Therefore it is unlikely they form a large block of voters and be influential. They're definitely less influential than the Jewish vote.

(2) If you're against Israeli policy it would tend to give way to people thinking you're anti-Jew and, well, oops. Antisemites are not people you want voting for you. Ignoring this block of voters is perfectly fine, since garnering their vote likely ends up in losing other voters.

So your arugmentation surrounding the picking up of voters against Israeli policy, or antisemites or whatever, is moot. There's not enough voters to overcome the loss of the 4.6%.

There is no incentive for politicians to change their position to one where they garner no votes. If anything, they'd hide under a rock if they feel anything against AIPAC since it could cause problems in their fellow party members' ridings.

&gt;it's that we have to elect people for their judgement

Americans elect people with nice hair cuts and fancy clothes, not their judgement. How else do you think McCain-Palin landed 45% of the vote in Nov. 2008? Politicians know this fact. It's all flare and no substance in the American circus we call politics. It is laudable to hope for a politician that breaks this mould but, quite frankly, if you are a politician by definition and vis-a-vis the system you have been made complicit in this theatrical system.

You seem a small bit trapped in thinking of politicians in terms of when they're currently in their term of office. That they are expected to act as a legislator or a governor while working for the people. This is not the case. A politicians is not a being who is centred on public service but public communication, with their talents being placed on communicating with people during elections--that small portion of their time once every few years. That's where their tactics in office go to and that's where their mind turns to when making decisions.

It benefits politicians to pander to certain groups and it is incentivised. AIPAC knows this and can channel those forces for its aims. There's enough of a population that it can communicate with and convince to its aims to impact enough of an election to have its voice heard and its aims followed.

That 5% is huge to politicians since they're trapped in the election, not governing, mindset. Judgement and conscience be damned by them--it's passion and politics alone that drives the American state.","1270093336"

You can configure it so that different strings in front of the issue number actually resolve the ticket as well.

There is support for plugins and there appears to be a pretty healthy amount of plugin development though I haven't tried installing any of them. I had wanted to install the chart plugin that gives you the same charts as the default Jira charts and I think there are others that may give you a better gant view of scheduled releases and the assigned tickets than the default.

And the worst taste like watered down grain alcohol.  That should be a hell of a lot cheaper.  Anything with vodka is just as good with gin or tequila.  I rarely drink scotch and don't like the taste of Tennessee whisky but would if I was in a pinch.  Most nights I'm stuck with beer, in which case I try to avoid the big guys, but if that's all that's available at a shitty gas station or what have you; I settle for a nice cold Coors Original, ""The Banquet Beer.""

Bone structure-wise she doesn't look particularly white, I'd say she's probably mixed race. Pretty girl, unfortunate lighting/makeup/photographer.

edit: I used to do makeup for some photographers in college and a lot of the darker models complained that makeup artists can never seem to match their makeup and skin tone. It's a pretty common problem, apparently. So it could also be that. I think the main problem though is just the photog getting too close with a reflector and over-exposing her face.","1270093382"

As for the rest of your comment, it's really interesting.  We both have a similar or identical goal in mind, and it's many times disconcerting to experience one who is diametrically opposed who is willing to engage in a civilized way.  I hope you've found the same in my comments.

I'm not sure we'd ever agree on the method to reach that goal, however.  We can agree on one thing, though - the government does tend to mess things up a bit.  My goal is to improve the government and make its interactions better, yours is to remove that interaction.

I still don't believe the free market is the place for health care, fire department, police and the like.  I just don't trust the free market to handle those things.  You may not trust the government, and that's ok.  As many examples as you can give showing why you distrust the government, I can give as examples why I don't trust free markets in humanitarian areas.  I do believe the shoe industry is better served by a free market.  And certainly cheese.

"latin","t5_2qloa","I am reading some of these comments, and one of my professors is an extremely smart latin mind who loves studying pronunciation. Let me just say that in regards to classical Latin, we still have no idea how it was really pronounced. Linguists believe that any word that ended with -m got nasalized, much like french. And in reading latin poetry, many words are blended together to almost sound like one word. Don't worry too much about pronunciation, as long as you keep your C's hard, your V's like W's and follow your macrons, you will do a decent job. And yes, it is vowel length which determines pretty much everything. 

Also, I haven't seen very much prose spoken quickly, mainly because its hard. Again we don't really know how exactly a Roman spoke it. However I have seen the clip go up when my professors (and to a lesser extent, myself) read poetry. Poetry goes quicker because of precise rules that are used when reading it though.

If you have any further questions, I would be glad to help, I'm a current Latin scholar and love the language.

"shittyadvice","t5_2rch1","I brought this idea up in another thread, and I think we could apply it here on shittyadvice:

Advertisers are desperately trying to connect with their demographic target; the more personal they can make their relationship with their customer, all the better for them. That's why they pay money to generate customer interest, and they'll pay *good* money to generate customer interest in their target demographic.

Reddit has the most mind-blowing demographic of them all -- younger, more educated, sometimes more affluent, but most definitely in the professional scheme of things.

I suspect, at this very moment, there are dozens of potential advertisers trying to physically break their way into reddit HQ in a desparate bid to win over redditor customer prospects.

Here's what we give them: 

The reddit karma store.

Here's how it works:

Based on an established amount of karma points *to be surrendered* by the purchaser, they give away *something* of value in return. It could be a promotional giveaway. It could be a discount. It could be a purchase voucher. As long as it's something.

Then, for every karma point spent by a reddit user, the advertiser would be assessed a promotional fee; let's actually call it a lead acquisition cost (because that's what it is).

Based upon more than three decades of experience in media, with half of that in marketing, I would expect the end results to be mind-blowing.

But, I *am* thehalfwit, and this is shittyadvice.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","If you want a PC headset under $100 but still be quality, check out the Sonar 5.1 headset. I've had 'em for years and I've tried Razer, Steelseries, Sennheiser, and Logitech headsets, but nothing beats the Sonar 5.1s for its price.

Best bang for buck is the [Cyber Snipa sonar 5.1](http://www.cybersnipa.com/us/products/sonar-5.1-gaming-headset.php)  headset-bar none. It's only $48. Has nice comfortable valuer headphones (I can wear them for hours on end without ear pain) and (most important) FULLY adjustable microphone that have great reception. 

I can't tell you how many PC headsets I went through had crappy adjustable microphones. Oh and I hope you like red, because it is the only color offered. =P

Anything lower in price and you are giving up a lot in the sound quality department and comfort. Anything higher (and I mean HIGHER) and there is diminishing returns.

The next step up in price would be the [Razor Barracuda](http://www.razerzone.com/p-93-razer-barracuda-hp-1-51-channel-gaming-headphones.aspx), but it has a horrible not-very-adjustable microphone . I think since you needs a good microphone that this is a no go. It does however have a little better sound quality than the Sonar 5.1. I wouldn't, in your case, give up the comfort and adjustable microphone of the Sonar headset for just a tiny sound quality upgrade. 

You could go steps higher, but any higher (+$120) and it starts to get expensive/diminishing returns after the Razor Barracuda. ","1270093481"

You seem to be looking for a very specific subset of games that are played by a large crowd *and* focused on a solid plot. This isn't the only way to do things. This isn't necessarily even a good idea. If you're trying to work through a large epic story, you lose the sense of being the hero if you're just one gun in a crowd. You don't get to make any decisions, or you're stuck in an immersion-breaking vote. Big multiplayer experiences don't inspire immersion in a story.

Now, a crazy talented studio could try to make a military game where you work with 63 friends in a unit to be the heroes. Decision making could take on an interesting dynamic in this situation too.

Thing is, this would be a very specific game made for crowds of 64 gamers that very rarely exist, and are a logistical nightmare to get going. It's certainly not necessary for videogames to be socially accepted. ","1270093520"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","This happens a lot, especially if this is the first time you've gone through an exercise cycle. We become WAY more critical of our body when we're losing weight.

Plus, if you've gone your life not having much muscle mass, you gain a lot of muscle as you exercise that you won't have had before. It can cause a bulging gut to begin with (As it happens a lot with males, as abdominal muscles strengthen beneath the fitter and tighter which pushes the fat out.)

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have a couple of questions for you, as well as a few suggestions based on my having been in a relationship that ended similarly:

Why did she move so far away from you? Was it her decision to do so?  Have you talked to her about the fact that thoughts of her consume your life? At least if you do you'll be able to tell if she's being a cold-hearted bitch, in which case she's moved on, and you have no hope.  Have you thought about why she hasn't made any effort to come out and visit you?  She's probably already come to terms with the fact that it isn't going to work.  This probably isn't easy for her, but it is doubtful that she is going to express that at all toward you if you keep trying to win her back.  If she really loved you, it will get to her eventually and she'll feel bad about having to let you go. Only then should you try to get back together.... but have it be on her terms. Women run away from clingy men, and that is exactly what you seem to be right now.

My advise, like many others here is that you should try to move on.  Unfortunately you will always be comparing every girl that you meet to her, be it consciously or unconsciously, and that part is the hardest part to get over. Once you can truly remove your romantic thoughts of being with her again things will be easier.  You shouldn't completely remove her from your life, but it will definitely enable you to move on.  The most important part however is to remain friends.  Nothing is as tragic as having things get nasty during a breakup. It can only lead to a worse heartbreak, and you don't want that.  Good luck though, and I hope you feel better about all this with time.","1270093543"

Square enix is the lazy ones, not yahtzee. a game developer should make sure the pacing and game play is fun from start to finish, otherwise they arent doing their job right.

no one plays final fantasy expecting ""something different"". everyone knows what they're getting into. how could they not? the game series has gone virtually unchanged since its first iteration, and I think thats a big problem.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I've spent a total of eight days in county jail.  Four days each, twice.  It wasn't so bad, it's good to see what goes on there, in a way.  But 45 days is pretty long.

I'll tell you one thing that happened, though.  This was in southern California and they kept blacks and Latinos separate to avoid violence, and mixed whites like me in with them.  So our tank was controlled by a Mexican gang.  The guards used them to help keep order.  It mostly worked out.  There wasn't much violence, no sexual assault or weapons that I saw.  But one day I was issued a brand new orange jump suit.  I didn't care what kind of jump suit I had, but apparently the Mexican gang members liked new jump suits.  So they took mine when I was in the shower and left an old one that was too small.  I didn't mind it being old, but I asked the guy who obviously took it to give me a bigger one, and he punched me.  I fought back because that's what I always do and the other whites yelled, ""One on one"", so they wouldn't gang up on me, and we traded punches until the guards came.  Some Mexicans whispered, ""Don't say anything"" and I took their advice.  And that was the end of it, although  I was glad I got out the next day.  The gang leader came up to me and said, ""So you were here just long enough to challenge my authority!"". I didn't give a shit one way or the other about his authority, but that's how he saw it.

I don't mean to scare you.  After all nothing really happened.  But there is a different culture in there and it's easy to make a mistake without realizing it.  I was just stupid, I guess.  I should have put up with the small jump suit until I was issued another one.  And fighting back was probably dumb, too.  If you mostly stick with people of your own race (I know, but things are different in jail) and take advice from people who've been there a while you'll get through it fine.  You'll probably meet some interesting people, too.

America's legal system is a mess.  I'm not fond of the Chinese approach to pretty much anything.  At least when there's innocent people executed interesting documentaries can be made about their unfortunate demise.","1270093609"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","i feel what he is saying is completely correct. However the human mind is very powerful, if you have children, but in your heart of hearts didnt want them you would still have to disagree with him and downvote him, for your own ideology's sake.  you have to protect your paradigm, or you wake up tomorrow morning thinking ""what a useless life""  

CaughtInTheNet makes a very compelling point but parents brainwash themselves to think ""this misery isnt that bad, infact it kinda feels good. I always wanted to give up 20 years of my life and be enslaved to this thing that came out of that woman I married.""  this isnt the thought you had when you were young and always wanted to follow your dreams and saw life to be a free existance, but you rightfully have to convince yourself this is retrospectively what you wanted.  

I look at religious people and wish"" my god i wish i could i have tunnel vision and be so ambivalent about my life wasting away.""  I feel this is the same mind power that allows parents to convince themselves ""THIS is my dream life."" with a half disappointed smile.  ","1270093612"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I second this, I got a set of Steelsound 3H's a couple of years ago from a woot.com sale, and absolutely love them. Best money I ever spent on headset/mic combo. I haven't had any problem with my mike, and they are very comfortable, but they tend to block out all sound from the outside which could be a bad thing - if you want to hear your phone(or anything else for that matter)","1270093613"
"programming","t5_2fwo","Your boolean snippet trick is not exactly the same.  In your indexing trick both true and false values are evaluated.  In the if version, only the necessary one is.  The real way to do this is:

    true_val if cond else false_val

"politics","t5_2cneq","They said that Obama doesn't go far enough. You are all retarded.

&gt; President Barack Obama’s plan to allow expanded offshore oil and gas exploration won rebuke from the top House Republican on Wednesday.
House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) dismissed the president’s plan as not going far enough in opening up U.S. waters for exploration.
Obama’s decision “continues to defy the will of the American people,” Boehner said in a statement, pointing to the president’s decision to open Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico waters, while leaving Pacific and many Alaskan waters largely closed to exploration.","1270093614"
